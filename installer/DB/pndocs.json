Project description, project structure, and the capabilities and limitations are briefly discussed to elucidate the finished project. The result of the evaluation and its interpretation was also presented in this chapter. Project Description The Cryptographic IM (CIM) system is an instant messaging application that allows data communication among peers. It provides essential features for office collaboration such as one-to-one chat, group chat, file transfer, and others. Multi-layered encryption is integrated into the CIM to provide greater security. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm encrypts the data as it traverses across the network. The system was developed in modules or components making it agile in any type of deployment. Meaning, the CIM can be deployed even without the other modules if it is not required for a particular deployment. There are three (3) modules developed, the base, file transfer, and the encryption module. The base component provides the platform for the two (2) components and other future components to be integrated into. These future components can also be a third-party DLL, API, or SDK. Project Structure The CIM was developed using the Microsoft Visual C# 2017. It runs on both MS Windows 7 and Windows 10 platform and requires dot.Net 4.6 framework. Microsoft Access database engine was included during the installation to allow local storage of user lists and other settings. The figure below shows the final structure of the system.

  "content": "09 January 2019 Nelson Maligro, ON6 Philippine Navy Via email: nelsonmaligro@gmail.com Dear Sir: Thank you for meeting with us last November 2018 to discuss your document management requirements. May we take this opportunity to summarize the Globodox DMS objectives discussed during the meeting: 1. To respond quickly to the search/retrieval of records. Globodox DMS provides several search methods including the retrieval of records by indices or by a document's content, very similar to how a search and retrieve is made in Yahoo or Google. 2. To demonstrate office efficiency. Retrieval of records can be by school name, by teacher's name such as last name, first name, middle name, locality, and other fields. FMWC would like to define. Globodox DMS provides simple and advance search functions. 3. To have a backup of records electronically. Electronic records (scanned civil registry images, Microsoft Office files, email, and other forms of electronic files) placed into Globodox DMS can be copied into external medias to serve as a backup of original paper and office records. 4. To maintain disaster recovery measures in times of fire, rain, and earthquakes. In case of disaster, Globodox DMS can utilize these external disks/CDs and recreate the server database for business continuity. Floro International Corporation Unit 717B, ACG Buding Shaw Boulevard, Wack Wack, Mandaluyong Phone 533-2584 Fax: 654-7215 email: floro@floro-intl.com www.floro-intl.com, www.digitizingdocuments.com 2000-001 5. To relieve employees from clerical activities such as searching, retrieving and printing. 6. To provide security of original documents. Paper documents do not need to be accessed, thereby minimizing loss or misfiled documents though the use of Globodox DMS. Moreover, minimizing the handling of paper documents minimizes the wear and tear caused by handling. 7. To provide transfer of technology to the employees of FMWC through training and implementation of the Globodox DMS system. We have ",

  "content": "Chapter 3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY This chapter presents the project design and project development to provide blueprint of the entire system architecture. Operational procedure and method of testing and evaluation are explained to measure its effectiveness based on predefined parameters. Project Design The Cryptographic Instant Messaging (CIM) system is Instant Messaging (IM) application software that provides encrypted chat communication and file transfer for secure and reliable exchange of information. Figure 2. Interface Diagram of CIM IM Relay Server INTERNET Encrypt Decrypt Receive Send Client X Client Y 1588081911698 28 Operational Concept and Dataflow Figure 2 from the previous page illustrates the fundamental structure of the system and flow of data from an end-user's perspective. Client X initiates a chat conversation with Client Y using the CIM client software. During the chat conversation, the system automatically encrypts the text message prior sending it to the IM Relay Server. The server now searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server transmits the encrypted text message to Client Y (recipient) through its socket. The server manages all clients' sockets. It handles authentication of all incoming clients prior acceptance of the socket. IM Relay Server maintains a minimal database using MS SQL Server, SQL Express, or MS Access for accounts and activity logs. As soon as the text message arrived at Client Y (recipient), the software then decrypts the text using the system-generated key as the default. Unreadable message or randomized characters indicates unmatched passkey. Both Client X (sender) and Client Y (recipient) must encode manually the correct or agreed passkey to decode their conversation. The manual encoding of a passkey is done to deny the system administrator or any authority from decoding the message during the conduct of any special investigation. System generated key",

Any questions about how this tool works or suggestions can be directed to info@auditscripts.com. In order to use this tool, the assessor must only complete the answers to the drop down menu questions lists on the pages labeled CSC #1 - CSC #20. By choosing a drop down choice for each critical control, the assessment tool will automatically generate scores and maturity level based on the answers to each question. Based on the answers to each question, the dashboard worksheet will automatically populate with the overall maturity level scores for the organization as a whole. These scores can therefore be used to measure the organization's progress and what percentage of the Critical Security Controls they are currently following. Ideally in the long term organizations would deploy tools that would automate the collection of this information, but in the meanwhile, this tool can be used to help start the process of manually assessing the organization's maturity level.\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Field Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ID,,,This is the ID number of the specific critical security control sub-control reference as included in the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, Critical Security Control Detail,,,This is the detail behind each specific sub-control as defined by the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, EOF Function,,,\"This standards for \"\"Executive Order Framework (EOF)\"\" function.

It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user-friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their office communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making.

GENERAL: In order to reinforce efforts to address cyber-related issues and develop the AFP cyber defense capability, there is a need to first determine the current AFP cyber security posture. The best way to accomplish this is through the conduct of a Cyber Risk Assessment (CRA) among AFP units. However, a standard guide by means of a policy on CRA should, therefore, be at hand. The SANS Top 20 Critical Security Controls which is being used as a recommended set of actions for cyber defense that provide specific and actionable ways to stop today's most pervasive and dangerous attacks. The SANS Institute, together with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and other organizations, developed the 20 Critical Security Controls (CSC) for effective cyber defense as a response to the growing security threats.The Controls have best-in-class threat data and transform it into actionable guidance to improve individual and collective security in cyberspace. PURPOSE: This SOPprescribes general guidelines to units 6's and CEIS units in order to ensure cybersecurity AFP-wide. This SOP shall likewise, be the basis for unit Commanders, Heads/Chiefs of offices to determine the unit's cyber security posture. SCOPE: This covers all AFP Staff Officer for CEIS and AFP CEIS units. DEFINITION OF TERMS: a.

  "content": "The original Bata Batuta 1970 US release of The Man Who Sold the World employed a cartoon-like cover drawing by Bowie's friend Michael J. Weller, featuring a cowboy in front of the Cane Hill mental asylum.[16] Weller, whose friend was a patient there, suggested the idea after Bowie had asked him to create a design that would capture the music's foreboding tone. Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John Wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten-gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risqué and the balloon was left blank. According to Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg, \"at this point, David's intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's Metropolis: the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man Who Sold the World.\"[4] Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance.[4] The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish.[17] It has been said that his \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo, were inspired b",

  "content": "The original 1970 US tinda muta release of The Man Who Sold the World employed a cartoon-like cover drawing by Bowie's friend Michael J. Weller, featuring a cowboy in front of the Cane Hill mental asylum.[16] Weller, whose friend was a patient there, suggested the idea after Bowie had asked him to create a design that would capture the music's foreboding tone. Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John Wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten-gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\".

According to Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg, \"at this point, David's intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's Metropolis: the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man Who Sold the World.\"[4] Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover.

  "content": "The original Bata Batuta 1970 US release of The Man Who Sold the World employed a cartoon-like cover drawing by Bowie's friend Michael J. Weller, featuring a cowboy in front of the Cane Hill mental asylum.[16] Weller, whose friend was a patient there, suggested the idea after Bowie had asked him to create a design that would capture the music's foreboding tone. Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John Wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten-gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risqué and the balloon was left blank. According to Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg, \"at this point, David's intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's Metropolis: the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man Who Sold the World.\"[4] Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance.[4] The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish.[17] It has been said that his \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo, were inspired b",

  "content": "Chapter 1 `INTRODUCTION Background of the Study Data exchange or data communication is a key process of providing accurate and timely information to senior leaders, top management, and decision makers. It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user-friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their office communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making. In today's network-centric operation, Instant Messaging (IM) is an essential information communication tool for rapid delivery of messages and reports, and for situational awareness. The US military has long been using IM for its military operations. In fact, Cummings (2004, p. 654) stated that \"it was the primary means of communication between navy ships during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003\".

No inventory of authorized and unauthorized devices Program for Asset Management System such as MS Active Directory 2. Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software Identify vulnerable or malicious software to mitigate or root out attacks: Devise a list of authorized software for each type of system, and deploy tools to track software installed (including type, version, and patches) and monitor for unauthorized or unnecessary software. 3. Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices, Laptop, Workstations, and Servers Prevent attackers from exploiting services and settings that allow easy access through networks and browsers: Build a secure image that is used for all new systems deployed to the enterprises, host these standard images on secure storage servers, regularly validate and update these configurations, and track system images in a configuration management system. 4. Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation Proactively identify and repair software vulnerabilities reported by security researchers or vendors: Regularly run automated vulnerability scanning tools against all systems and quickly remediate any vulnerabilities, which critical problems fixed within 48 hours. 5. Malware Defenses Block malicious code from tampering with system settings or contents, capturing sensitive data, or spreading: Use automated anti-virus and anti- 1588086734587 spyware to continuously monitor and protect workstations, servers, and mobile devices.

  "content": "Chapter 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This chapter presents the final output of the system and the result of the evaluation. Project description, project structure, and the capabilities and limitations are briefly discussed to elucidate the finished project. The result of the evaluation and its interpretation was also presented in this chapter. Project Description The Cryptographic IM (CIM) system is an instant messaging application that allows data communication among peers. It provides essential features for office collaboration such as one-to-one chat, group chat, file transfer, and others. Multi-layered encryption is integrated into the CIM to provide greater security. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm encrypts the data as it traverses across the network. The system was developed in modules or components making it agile in any type of deployment. Meaning, the CIM can be deployed even without the other modules if it is not required for a particular deployment. There are three (3) modules developed, the base, file transfer, and the encryption module. The base component provides the platform for the two (2) components and other future components to be integrated into. These future components can also be a third-party DLL, API, or SDK. 1587566197156 22 Apr 2020 1587566304449 48 Project Structure The CIM was developed using the Microsoft Visual C# 2017.

AFP Cyber Strategy. Circular nr 29 dated 06 December 2017, Subject: PN Cybersecurity Policy. 20 Critical Security Controls by SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security (SANS) Institute. 2. GENERAL: In order to reduce the ability of attackers to find and exploit unauthorized and unprotected systems, there is a need to use active monitoring, manage configuration and maintain an up-to-date inventory of devices connected to the enterprise network, including servers, workstations, laptops, and remote devices. Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all software on the network so that only authorized software is installed and can execute, and that unauthorized and unmanaged software is found and prevented from installation or execution. Maintaining inventories for hardware and software will identify vulnerable systems, detect malicious software, mitigate unpatched software, and root out attacks. PURPOSE: This SOP prescribes the general guidelines to units 6's and CEIS units for the inventory of Information Technology (IT) hardware and software SCOPE: This covers all PN Staff Officer for CEIS/C4ISR and PN CEIS units. DEFINITION OF TERMS: Asset - is any data, device, or other component of the environment that supports information-related activities. Assets generally include hardware (e.g. servers and switches), software (e.g. mission critical applications and support systems) and confidential information.

It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user-friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their office communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making. In today's network-centric operation, Instant Messaging (IM) is an essential information communication tool for rapid delivery of messages and reports, and for situational awareness. The US military has long been using IM for its military operations.

It explores the earlier developments, previous research, and existing technologies leading to the development of a prototype cryptographic IM (CIM). It includes the operational de nition of terms used, and the conceptual framework to visually synthesize all materials and techniques in achieving the desired objective. Review of Related Literature and Studies Historical Development of Instant Messaging (III!) The advent of Instant Messenger like Facebook Messenger, Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other popular IM revolutionizes the way people communicate with each other. But its impressive features would not be possible without the earlier breakthrough of their predecessors. Desjardin (2016), in his article \"The Evolution of Instant Messaging\", narrates the written accounts that brought the IM and how it grows prominence in the new era. Instant Messaging became known in the l990's but decades ago Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) already demonstrated an information sharing program called Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). In 1988, Jarkko Oikarinen developed the first chat system that allows sending messages to users through their computers (Oikarinen, 1988). His Internet Relay Chat (IRC) paved the way for other IM players like AOL IM, ICQ, and Microsoft IRC to battle for share in the IM market. Yahoo messenger ",

Project description, project structure, and the capabilities and limitations are brie y discussed to elucidate the nished project. The result of the evaluation and its interpretation was also presented in this chapter. Project Description The Cryptographic IM (CIM) system is an instant messaging application that allows data communication among peers. It provides essential features for of ce collaboration such as one-to-one chat, group chat, le transfer, and others. Multi-layered encryption is integrated into the CIM to provide greater security. Advanced Encryption Standard (ABS) and the Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm encrypts the data as it traverses across the network. The system was developed in modules or components making it agile in any type of deployment. Meaning, the CIM can be deployed even without the other modules if it is not required for a particular deployment. There are three (3) modules developed, the base, le transfer, and the encryption module. The base component provides the platform for the two (2) components and other future components to be integrated into. These future components can also be a third-party DLL, API, or SDK. ",

Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten—gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risque and the balloon was left blank. According to Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg, \"at this point, David's intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's Metropolis: the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man who Sold the world.\"[4] Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance.[4] The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish.[17] It has been said that his \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo, were inspired ",

  "content": " Chapter 1 â INTRODUCTION Background of the Study Data exchange or data communication is a key process of providing accurate and timely information to senior leaders, top management, and decision makers. It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user- friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-Way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their ofďŹce communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making.

May We Take This opporTuniTy To summarize The Globodox DIv\\S objecTives discussed during The meeTing: i. To respond quickly To The search/reTrieval of records. Globodox DMS provides several search meThods including The reTrieval of records by indices or by a documenT's conTenT, very similar To how a search and reTrieve is made in Yahoo or Google. 2. To demonsTraTe office efficiency. Refrieval of records can be by school name, by Teacher's name such as lasT name, firsT name, middle name, localiTy, and oTher fields. FMWC would like To define. Globodox DMS provides simple and advance search funcTions. 3. To have a backup of records elecTronically. ElecTronic records (scanned civil regisTry images, Iv\\icrosofT Office files, email, and oTher forms of elecTronic files) placed inTo Globodox DIv\\S can be copied inTo exTernal medias To serve as a backup of original paper and office records. 4. To mainTain disasTer recovery measures in Times of fire, rain, and earThaual<es. In case of disasTer, Globodox DMS can uTilize These exTernal disl<s/CDs and recreaTe The server daTabase for business conTinuiTy. 2000-001 ",

Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten—gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risque and the balloon was left blank. According to Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg, \"at this point, David's intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's Metropolis: the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man who Sold the world.\"[4] Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance.[4] The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish.[17] It has been said that his \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo, were inspired ",

May We Take This opporTuniTy To summarize The Globodox DIv\\S objecTives discussed during The meeTing: i. To respond quickly To The search/reTrieval of records. Globodox DMS provides several search meThods including The reTrieval of records by indices or by a documenT's conTenT, very similar To how a search and reTrieve is made in Yahoo or Google. 2. To demonsTraTe office efficiency. Refrieval of records can be by school name, by Teacher's name such as lasT name, firsT name, middle name, localiTy, and oTher fields. FMWC would like To define. Globodox DMS provides simple and advance search funcTions. 3. To have a backup of records elecTronically. ElecTronic records (scanned civil regisTry images, Iv\\icrosofT Office files, email, and oTher forms of elecTronic files) placed inTo Globodox DIv\\S can be copied inTo exTernal medias To serve as a backup of original paper and office records. 4. To mainTain disasTer recovery measures in Times of fire, rain, and earThaual<es.

  "content": " The original Bata Batuta 1970 US release of The Man who Sold the world employed a cartoon—like cover drawing by Bowie's friend Michael J. weller, featuring a cowboy in front of the Cane Hill mental asylum.[16] weller, whose friend was a patient there, suggested the idea after Bowie had asked him to create a design that would capture the music's foreboding tone. Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten—gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risque and the balloon was left blank. According to Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg, \"at this point, David's intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's Metropolis: the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man who Sold the world.\"[4] Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance.[4] The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish.[17] It has been said that his \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo, were inspired ",

  "content": " Chapter 1 â INTRODUCTION Background of the Study Data exchange or data communication is a key process of providing accurate and timely information to senior leaders, top management, and decision makers. It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user- friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-Way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their ofďŹce communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making.

Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten—gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risque and the balloon was left blank.

The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance.[4] The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish.[17] It has been said that his \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo, were inspired ",

Any questions about how this tool works or suggestions can be directed to info@auditscripts.com. In order to use this tool, the assessor must only complete the answers to the drop down menu questions lists on the pages labeled CSC #1 - CSC #20. By choosing a drop down choice for each critical control, the assessment tool will automatically generate scores and maturity level based on the answers to each question. Based on the answers to each question, the dashboard worksheet will automatically populate with the overall maturity level scores for the organization as a whole. These scores can therefore be used to measure the organization's progress and what percentage of the Critical Security Controls they are currently following. Ideally in the long term organizations would deploy tools that would automate the collection of this information, but in the meanwhile, this tool can be used to help start the process of manually assessing the organization's maturity level.\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Field Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ID,,,This is the ID number of the specific critical security control sub-control reference as included in the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, Critical Security Control Detail,,,This is the detail behind each specific sub-control as defined by the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, EOF Function,,,\"This standards for \"\"Executive Order Framework (EOF)\"\" function.

Project description, project structure, and the capabilities and limitations are briefly discussed to elucidate the finished project. The result of the evaluation and its interpretation was also presented in this chapter. Project Description The Cryptographic IM (CIM) system is an instant messaging application that allows data communication among peers. It provides essential features for office collaboration such as one-to-one chat, group chat, file transfer, and others. Multi-layered encryption is integrated into the CIM to provide greater security. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm encrypts the data as it traverses across the network. The system was developed in modules or components making it agile in any type of deployment. Meaning, the CIM can be deployed even without the other modules if it is not required for a particular deployment. There are three (3) modules developed, the base, file transfer, and the encryption module. The base component provides the platform for the two (2) components and other future components to be integrated into. These future components can also be a third-party DLL, API, or SDK. Project Structure The CIM was developed using the Microsoft Visual C# 2017. It runs on both MS Windows 7 and Windows 10 platform and requires dot.Net 4.6 framework. Microsoft Access database engine was included during the installation to allow local storage of user lists and other settings. The figure below shows the final structure of the system.

It explores the earlier developments, previous research, and existing technologies leading to the development of a prototype cryptographic IM (CIM). It includes the operational definition of terms used, and the conceptual framework to visually synthesize all materials and techniques in achieving the desired objective. Review of Related Literature and Studies Historical Development of Instant Messaging (IM) The advent of Instant Messenger like Facebook Messenger, Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other popular IM revolutionizes the way people communicate with each other. But its impressive features would not be possible without the earlier breakthrough of their predecessors. Desjardin (2016), in his article \"The Evolution of Instant Messaging\", narrates the written accounts that brought the IM and how it grows prominence in the new era. Instant Messaging became known in the 1990's but decades ago Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) already demonstrated an information sharing program called Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). In 1988, Jarkko Oikarinen developed the first chat system that allows sending messages to users through their computers (Oikarinen, 1988). His Internet Relay Chat (IRC) paved the way for other IM players like AOL IM, ICQ, and Microsoft IRC to battle for share in the IM market. Yahoo messenger dominates in 1998 with its intuitive designs and feature-rich IM environment. Engel (2014) recounts how IM grow prominence in the 2000s. This was the golden age of instant messenger. MSN Messenger introduced the concept of sharing photos and included the PC-to-PC and PC-to-phone audio capabilities. Skype Messenger peaked in popularity in 2003 as it showcased Audio and Video chat capabilities. Facebook chat was first introduced in 2008 and accelerated its popularity in 2014 when it decouples from the Facebo",

May we take this opportunity to summarize the Globodox DMS objectives discussed during the meeting: 1. To respond quickly to the search/retrieval of records. Globodox DMS provides several search methods including the retrieval of records by indices or by a document's content, very similar to how a search and retrieve is made in Yahoo or Google. 2. To demonstrate office efficiency. Retrieval of records can be by school name, by teacher's name such as last name, first name, middle name, locality, and other fields. FMWC would like to define. Globodox DMS provides simple and advance search functions. 3. To have a backup of records electronically. Electronic records (scanned civil registry images, Microsoft Office files, email, and other forms of electronic files) placed into Globodox DMS can be copied into external medias to serve as a backup of original paper and office records. 4. To maintain disaster recovery measures in times of fire, rain, and earthquakes. In case of disaster, Globodox DMS can utilize these external disks/CDs and recreate the server database for business continuity. Floro International Corporation Unit 717B, ACG Buding Shaw Boulevard, Wack Wack, Mandaluyong Phone 533-2584 Fax: 654-7215 email: floro@floro-intl.com www.floro-intl.com, www.digitizingdocuments.com 2000-001 5. To relieve employees from clerical activities such as searching, retrieving and printing. 6. To provide security of original documents. Paper documents do not need to be accessed, thereby minimizing loss or misfiled documents though the use of Globodox DMS. Moreover, minimizing the handling of paper documents minimizes the wear and tear caused by handling. 7. To provide transfer of technology to the employees of FMWC through training and implementation of the Globodox DMS system. We have ",

  "content": "The original Bata Batuta 1970 US release of The Man Who Sold the World employed a cartoon-like cover drawing by Bowie's friend Michael J. Weller, featuring a cowboy in front of the Cane Hill mental asylum.[16] Weller, whose friend was a patient there, suggested the idea after Bowie had asked him to create a design that would capture the music's foreboding tone. Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John Wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten-gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risqué and the balloon was left blank. According to Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg, \"at this point, David's intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's Metropolis: the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man Who Sold the World.\"[4] Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance.[4] The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish.[17] It has been said that his \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo, were inspired b",

It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user-friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their office communication.

  "content": "Chapter 1 `INTRODUCTION Background of the Study Data exchange or data communication is a key process of providing accurate and timely information to senior leaders, top management, and decision makers. It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user-friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their office communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making. In today's network-centric operation, Instant Messaging (IM) is an essential information communication tool for rapid delivery of messages and reports, and for situational awareness. The US military has long been using IM for its military operations. In fact, Cummings (2004, p. 654) stated that \"it was the primary means of communication between navy ships during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003\".

It explores the earlier developments, previous research, and existing technologies leading to the development of a prototype cryptographic IM (CIM). It includes the operational definition of terms used, and the conceptual framework to visually synthesize all materials and techniques in achieving the desired objective. Review of Related Literature and Studies Historical Development of Instant Messaging (IM) The advent of Instant Messenger like Facebook Messenger, Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other popular IM revolutionizes the way people communicate with each other. But its impressive features would not be possible without the earlier breakthrough of their predecessors. Desjardin (2016), in his article \"The Evolution of Instant Messaging\", narrates the written accounts that brought the IM and how it grows prominence in the new era. Instant Messaging became known in the 1990's but decades ago Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) already demonstrated an information sharing program called Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). In 1988, Jarkko Oikarinen developed the first chat system that allows sending messages to users through their computers (Oikarinen, 1988). His Internet Relay Chat (IRC) paved the way for other IM players like AOL IM, ICQ, and Microsoft IRC to battle for share in the IM market. Yahoo messenger dominates in 1998 with its intuitive designs and feature-rich IM environment. Engel (2014) recounts how IM grow prominence in the 2000s. This was the golden age of instant messenger. MSN Messenger introduced the concept of sharing photos and included the PC-to-PC and PC-to-phone audio capabilities. Skype Messenger peaked in popularity in 2003 as it showcased Audio and Video chat capabilities. Facebook chat was first introduced in 2008 and accelerated its popularity in 2014 when it decouples from the Facebo",

Project description, project structure, and the capabilities and limitations are briefly discussed to elucidate the finished project. The result of the evaluation and its interpretation was also presented in this chapter. Project Description The Cryptographic IM (CIM) system is an instant messaging application that allows data communication among peers. It provides essential features for office collaboration such as one-to-one chat, group chat, file transfer, and others. Multi-layered encryption is integrated into the CIM to provide greater security. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm encrypts the data as it traverses across the network. The system was developed in modules or components making it agile in any type of deployment. Meaning, the CIM can be deployed even without the other modules if it is not required for a particular deployment. There are three (3) modules developed, the base, file transfer, and the encryption module. The base component provides the platform for the two (2) components and other future components to be integrated into. These future components can also be a third-party DLL, API, or SDK. Project Structure The CIM was developed using the Microsoft Visual C# 2017. It runs on both MS Windows 7 and Windows 10 platform and requires dot.Net 4.6 framework. Microsoft Access database engine was included during the installation to allow local storage of user lists and other settings. The figure below shows the final structure of the system.

Interface Diagram of CIM Operational Concept and Dataflow Figure 2 from the previous page illustrates the fundamental structure of the system and flow of data from an end-user's perspective. Client X initiates a chat conversation with Client Y using the CIM client software. During the chat conversation, the system automatically encrypts the text message prior sending it to the IM Relay Server. The server now searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server transmits the encrypted text message to Client Y (recipient) through its socket. The server manages all clients' sockets. It handles authentication of all incoming clients prior acceptance of the socket. IM Relay Server maintains a minimal database using MS SQL Server, SQL Express, or MS Access for accounts and activity logs. As soon as the text message arrived at Client Y (recipient), the software then decrypts the text using the system-generated key as the default. Unreadable message or randomized characters indicates unmatched passkey. Both Client X (sender) and Client Y (recipient) m",

  "content": "Chapter 1 `INTRODUCTION Background of the Study Data exchange or data communication is a key process of providing accurate and timely information to senior leaders, top management, and decision makers. It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user-friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their office communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making. In today's network-centric operation, Instant Messaging (IM) is an essential information communication tool for rapid delivery of messages and reports, and for situational awareness. The US military has long been using IM for its military operations. In fact, Cummings (2004, p. 654) stated that \"it was the primary means of communication between navy ships during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003\".

  "content": " 25 Chapter 2 CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK This chapter presents the review of previous literatures and studies related to Instant Messaging applications. It explores the earlier developments, previous research, and existing technologies leading to the development of a prototype cryptographic IM (CIM). It includes the operational definition of terms used, and the conceptual framework to visually synthesize all materials and techniques in achieving the desired objective. Review of Related Literature and Studies Historical Development of Instant Messaging (IM) The advent of Instant Messenger like Facebook Messenger, Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other popular IM revolutionizes the way people communicate with each other. But its impressive features would not be possible without the earlier breakthrough of their predecessors. Desjardin (2016), in his article \"The Evolution of Instant Messaging\", narrates the written accounts that brought the IM and how it grows prominence in the new era. Instant Messaging became known in the 1990's but decades ago Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) already demonstrated an information sharing program called Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). In 1988, Jarkko Oikarinen developed the first chat system that allows sending messages to users through their computers (Oikarinen, 1988). His Internet Relay Chat (IRC) paved the way for other IM players like AOL IM, ICQ, and Microsoft IRC to battle for share in the IM market. Yahoo messenger dominates in 1998 with its intuitive designs and feature-rich IM environment. Engel (2014) recounts how IM grow prominence in the 2000s. This was the golden age of instant messenger. MSN Messenger introduced the concept of sharing photos and included the PC-to-PC and PC-to-phone audio capabilities. Skype Messenger peaked in popularity in 2003 as it showcased Audio and Video chat capabilities. Facebook chat was first introduced in 2008 and accelerated its popularity in 2014 when it decouples from the Facebo",

Interface Diagram of CIM Operational Concept and Dataflow Figure 2 from the previous page illustrates the fundamental structure of the system and flow of data from an end-user's perspective. Client X initiates a chat conversation with Client Y using the CIM client software. During the chat conversation, the system automatically encrypts the text message prior sending it to the IM Relay Server. The server now searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server transmits the encrypted text message to Client Y (recipient) through its socket. The server manages all clients' sockets. It handles authentication of all incoming clients prior acceptance of the socket. IM Relay Server maintains a minimal database using MS SQL Server, SQL Express, or MS Access for accounts and activity logs. As soon as the text message arrived at Client Y (recipient), the software then decrypts the text using the system-generated key as the default. Unreadable message or randomized characters indicates unmatched passkey. Both Client X (sender) and Client Y (recipient) m",

Weller, featuring a cowboy in front of the Cane Hill mental asylum.[16] Weller, whose friend was a patient there, suggested the idea after Bowie had asked him to create a design that would capture the music's foreboding tone. Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John Wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten-gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risqué and the balloon was left blank.

May we take this opportunity to summarize the Globodox DMS objectives discussed during the meeting: 1. To respond quickly to the search/retrieval of records. Globodox DMS provides several search methods including the retrieval of records by indices or by a document's content, very similar to how a search and retrieve is made in Yahoo or Google. 2. To demonstrate office efficiency. Retrieval of records can be by school name, by teacher's name such as last name, first name, middle name, locality, and other fields. FMWC would like to define. Globodox DMS provides simple and advance search functions. 3. To have a backup of records electronically. Electronic records (scanned civil registry images, Microsoft Office files, email, and other forms of electronic files) placed into Globodox DMS can be copied into external medias to serve as a backup of original paper and office records. 4. To maintain disaster recovery measures in times of fire, rain, and earthquakes. In case of disaster, Globodox DMS can utilize these external disks/CDs and recreate the server database for business continuity.

To relieve employees from clerical activities such as searching, retrieving and printing. 6. To provide security of original documents. Paper documents do not need to be accessed, thereby minimizing loss or misfiled documents though the use of Globodox DMS. Moreover, minimizing the handling of paper documents minimizes the wear and tear caused by handling. 7. To provide transfer of technology to the employees of FMWC through training and implementation of the Globodox DMS system. We have ",

  "content": "Chapter 1 `INTRODUCTION Background of the Study Data exchange or data communication is a key process of providing accurate and timely information to senior leaders, top management, and decision makers. It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user-friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their office communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making. In today's network-centric operation, Instant Messaging (IM) is an essential information communication tool for rapid delivery of messages and reports, and for situational awareness. The US military has long been using IM for its military operations. In fact, Cummings (2004, p. 654) stated that \"it was the primary means of communication between navy ships during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003\".

Any questions about how this tool works or suggestions can be directed to info@auditscripts.com. In order to use this tool, the assessor must only complete the answers to the drop down menu questions lists on the pages labeled CSC #1 - CSC #20. By choosing a drop down choice for each critical control, the assessment tool will automatically generate scores and maturity level based on the answers to each question. Based on the answers to each question, the dashboard worksheet will automatically populate with the overall maturity level scores for the organization as a whole. These scores can therefore be used to measure the organization's progress and what percentage of the Critical Security Controls they are currently following. Ideally in the long term organizations would deploy tools that would automate the collection of this information, but in the meanwhile, this tool can be used to help start the process of manually assessing the organization's maturity level.\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Field Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ID,,,This is the ID number of the specific critical security control sub-control reference as included in the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, Critical Security Control Detail,,,This is the detail behind each specific sub-control as defined by the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, EOF Function,,,\"This standards for \"\"Executive Order Framework (EOF)\"\" function.

Project description, project structure, and the capabilities and limitations are briefly discussed to elucidate the finished project. The result of the evaluation and its interpretation was also presented in this chapter. Project Description The Cryptographic IM (CIM) system is an instant messaging application that allows data communication among peers. It provides essential features for office collaboration such as one-to-one chat, group chat, file transfer, and others. Multi-layered encryption is integrated into the CIM to provide greater security. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm encrypts the data as it traverses across the network. The system was developed in modules or components making it agile in any type of deployment. Meaning, the CIM can be deployed even without the other modules if it is not required for a particular deployment. There are three (3) modules developed, the base, file transfer, and the encryption module. The base component provides the platform for the two (2) components and other future components to be integrated into. These future components can also be a third-party DLL, API, or SDK. Project Structure The CIM was developed using the Microsoft Visual C# 2017. It runs on both MS Windows 7 and Windows 10 platform and requires dot.Net 4.6 framework. Microsoft Access database engine was included during the installation to allow local storage of user lists and other settings. The figure below shows the final structure of the system.

As you know, it provides the means for all storage, management and dissemination of data, applications and communications for your business. When employees and customers are unable to access the servers, storage systems and networking devices that reside in the data center, your entire organization can shut down. Millions of dollars can be lost in a matter of minutes for businesses like banks, airlines, shipping facilities and online brokerages. Faced with these consequences, IT executives today must optimize their data centers, particularly the network infrastructure. When you consider that 70 percent of network downtime can be attributed to physical layer problems, specifically cabling faults, it's paramount that more consideration be given to infrastructure design. Within this white paper we introduce three principles, that when executed properly, will help you gain significant benefits and savings throughout the life of your data center. Page The Three Principles of Data Center Design When you understand the three principles of data center design, you are able to: Lower your total cost of ownership Support your future growth plans Reduce your risk of downtime Maximize performance Improve your ability to reconfigure Principle 1: Space Savings Environmentally controlled real estate is expensive. The cost of building a data center is more than $1,000 per square foot in some cases (see Table 1). Data center racks and equipment can take up an enormous amount of real estate, and the future demand for more network connections, bandwidth and storage may require even more space",

  "content": "Calculating Space and Power Density Requirements for Data Centers Revision 0 by Neil Rasmussen White Paper 155 The historic method of specifying data center power density using a single number of watts per square foot (or watts per square meter) is an unfortunate practice that has caused needless confusion as well as waste of energy and money. This paper demonstrates how the typical methods used to select and specify power density are flawed, and provides an improved approach for establishing space requirements, including recom- mended density specifications for typical situations. Executive summary by Schneider Electric White Papers are now part of the Schneider Electric white paper library produced by Schneider Electric's Data Center Science Center DCSC@Schneider-Electric.com Calculating Space and Power Density Requirements for Data Centers Schneider Electric – Data Center Science Center Rev 0 2 Two key design parameters for a data center are the IT load rating in kW and the physical size of the IT and equipment rooms. In principle, these are related by the concept of power density, which vaguely relates the building size to the IT load. Historically, it has been common to describe and specify data centers with phrases like \"2,000 square meters at 1,000 watts per square meter\". Terminology like this results in needless confusion and ambiguity in the data center specification. Furthermore, this historic approach often results in underutilized power and cooling equipment, which leads to reduced electrical efficiency and excessive first-time costs. This paper describes an improved method for specifying power density. Furthermore, this paper makes specific recommendations for power density for new data centers, based on a few simple data center characteristics. There are four major problems with the historic practice of describing power density in terms of watts per square foot or watts per square meter. 1.

Back sometime in May of 2013, the government websites of the Philippines are being taken down by \"Taiwanese\" keyboard warriors following the taiwanese fishermen incident, serving as payback. The Philippines is now taking a step towards safeguarding its digital network or the cyberspace. The digital world is becoming more and more vulnerable. As much as great inventions and technologies empower us, these pose real threats and can lead to unprecedented damage. Inadequate response to these incidents may result to national crisis. Statistics are truly alarming. Each minute somewhere around the world a cyberattack is being performed. Literally this very second, someone's computer is being hacked, someone's personal records, financial information, or intellectual property is being stolen and sold on the black market. The Philippine Military is no exception to this. Everyday your Philippine Navy experiences numerous cyber-attacks in an attempt to penetrate our network and some get through by means of inadvertent downloads and USB insertion. Criminals are stepping up their game and data breaches are increasingly common and devastating. That is why we need to act together – Government agencies, Private Sectors, NGO, Academe, and even households with internet connections. With that, Thank You at Mabuhay po tayong lahat! ",

Any questions about how this tool works or suggestions can be directed to info@auditscripts.com. In order to use this tool, the assessor must only complete the answers to the drop down menu questions lists on the pages labeled CSC #1 - CSC #20. By choosing a drop down choice for each critical control, the assessment tool will automatically generate scores and maturity level based on the answers to each question. Based on the answers to each question, the dashboard worksheet will automatically populate with the overall maturity level scores for the organization as a whole. These scores can therefore be used to measure the organization's progress and what percentage of the Critical Security Controls they are currently following. Ideally in the long term organizations would deploy tools that would automate the collection of this information, but in the meanwhile, this tool can be used to help start the process of manually assessing the organization's maturity level.\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Field Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ID,,,This is the ID number of the specific critical security control sub-control reference as included in the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, Category,,,This is the critical control category as defined by the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, Critical Security Control Detail,,,This is the detail behind each specific sub-control as defined by the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, EOF Function,,,\"This standards for \"\"Executive Order Framework (EOF)\"\" function.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to provide guidance to Philippine Navy units/offices to ensure compliances with minimally acceptable system configuration requirements as determined by the organization within the information security standards and best practices. Furthermore, this SOP shall provide guidance to PN units/offices to develop fixed reference in the development cycle or an agreed-upon specification of information systems. PN shall develop baseline configuration that shall serve as a documented basis for defining incremental change and encompasses many different aspects of the information systems. The baseline configuration shall be the center of the effective configuration management program whose purpose is to give definite basis for change control in a project by controlling various configuration items like work, features, system performance and other measurable configuration, which is basically defined specification that is considered the baseline for all changes that follow. In addition, this SOP is important process for establishing and maintaining secure information system configurations and provides important support for managing security risks in information systems. This SOP supports the policy and guidelines of the PN Cybersecurity Policy and adopted the National Institute for Standards and Technology Special Publication (NIST-SP) 800-53 for Configuration Management (CM) wherein the controls under the said publication were mapped in ISO/IEC 27001 for Information technology–Security Techniques–Information Security Management Systems–Requirements. 2. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY: This SOP applies to all personnel and third party stakeholders, who provide, administer, maintain, and operate PN information system services",

Maligro attended the product presentation of IELTA on 211300H November 2017 at the Manila Peninsula Hotel, Makati City. The proponent presented the Conceptus System, a social media and web intelligence platform. The following are salient features of the system: Passive intelligence collection from social media and the web through creation of a seemingly legit social media personality (Avatar) that will blend in with the group or person of interest (POI); Crawls social media, deep web, darknet and bitcoin websites to collect valuable intelligence information about the POI; Generates actionable recommendation to grow and improve the avatar's reputation; and Correlates information from bitcoin transactions to provide further insights into the identity of the POI. While similar products, like the Knowlesys, have already been introduced to the PN, this branch is unable to determine the value and cost-benefit analysis of the system since this is a tool for Intelligence gathering. As such, we shall forward its brochure and other pertinent information to the TIG, NISF for their evaluation. For information of the AC of NS for C4ISR Systems.

  "content": " LastActivityView v1.32 Copyright (c) 2012 - 2018 Nir Sofer Web site: http://www.nirsoft.net Description =========== LastActivityView is a tool for Windows operating system that collects information from various sources on a running system, and displays a log of actions made by the user and events occurred on this computer. The activity displayed by LastActivityView includes: Running .exe file, Opening open/save dialog-box, Opening file/folder from Explorer or other software, software installation, system shutdown/start, application or system crash, network connection/disconnection and more... You can easily export this information into csv/tab-delimited/xml/html file or copy it to the clipboard and then paste into Excel or other software. System Requirements =================== This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000 and up to Windows 10. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported. Known Limitations ================= This tool gathers information from various sources, including the Registry, the events log of Windows, the Prefetch folder of Windows (C:\\windows\\Prefetch), the MiniDump folder of Windows (C:\\Windows\\Minidump), and more... The accuracy and the availability of the information displayed by LastActivityView might be different from one system to another. For example, if the user or a software makes changes in the Registry, the action time displayed by LastActivityView might be wrong, because it's based on the modified time of some Registry keys. Also, for every type of action/event, there is some limitation according to the way that the information is saved in the system. For example, the 'Select file in open/save dialog-box' action is limited for one action of every file extension, so if the user opened 2 .doc files with the open/save dialog-box, only the last one will be displayed. Versions History ================ * Version 1.32: o Fix bug: On Windows 10/8 - In some folder names of 'View Folder in Explorer' items, Last",

PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to provide guidance to Philippine Navy units/offices to ensure compliances with minimally acceptable system configuration requirements as determined by the organization within the information security standards and best practices. Furthermore, this SOP shall provide guidance to PN units/offices to develop fixed reference in the development cycle or an agreed-upon specification of information systems. PN shall develop baseline configuration that shall serve as a documented basis for defining incremental change and encompasses many different aspects of the information systems. The baseline configuration shall be the center of the effective configuration management program whose purpose is to give definite basis for change control in a project by controlling various configuration items like work, features, system performance and other measurable configuration, which is basically defined specification that is considered the baseline for all changes that follow. In addition, this SOP is important process for establishing and maintaining secure information system configurations and provides important support for managing security risks in information systems. This SOP supports the policy and guidelines of the PN Cybersecurity Policy and adopted the National Institute for Standards and Technology Special Publication (NIST-SP) 800-53 for Configuration Management (CM) wherein the controls under the said publication were mapped in ISO/IEC 27001 for Information technology–Security Techniques–Information Security Management Systems–Requirements. 2.

Accessing, possessing, and distribution of digital content pertaining to frogs breaches both civil and criminal laws. Jack has also been accused by NRTDC of obtaining two highly confidential documents. One document encompasses the names, position, usernames and password of notable personnel within the company. The second company is a top secret technology invention report wherein Jack should not have had access to either of these documents. As a consultant who specialized in Digital Forensics investigation, I am tasked to examine an image of Jack's laptop which was seized with the appropriate warrants. An image of the hard disk was created using forensically sound practices. Only a logical acquisition was undertaken by the individual responsible for creating the forensic copy. The logical acquisition was undertaken in a forensically sound manner and the md5 value at the same time of acquisition was \"a72a04e309dc8aa20345db1e2ba4cd61\". To start the investigation, the examiner Samsung Ativ 7 Core i5 laptop to investigate the downloaded image of Jack Daniels hard disk through the use of the following applications; OSMount, OSForensics, Autopsy, Passware Password Recovery Kit Forensic and Truecrypt. With the use of OSForensics and Autopsy Tools, the examiner investigate, exploit and explore the recent activity made by Jack Daniel to the computer. Manually browsing and/or auto search was also conducted using both software to search any suspicious file specifically frogs that has been accessed by Jack Daniel to his laptop. After thorough search and analyzation, fifteen (15) frogs were located to different folder locations. Said files extensions were change intentionally by Jack Daniel to avoid easy detection a",

Under Section 49 of RA 9184 and its revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), it may be employed under any of the following conditions: (1) procurement of highly specialized types of goods (e.g., sophisticated defense equipment, complex air navigation systems, coal) and consulting services where only a few suppliers or consultants are known to be available, such that resorting to the public bidding method will not likely result in any additional suppliers or consultants participating in the bidding; or (2) procurement of major plant components where it is deemed advantageous to limit the bidding to known qualified bidders in order to maintain uniform quality and performance of the plant as a whole. Section 49.2 of the IRR of RA 9184 provides that the pre-selected suppliers or consultants shall be those appearing in a list maintained by the relevant government authority that has expertise in the type of procurement concerned. The list of pre-selected suppliers or consultants shall be updated periodically. A copy of the list shall be submitted to, and maintained updated with, the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB). In addition, the IRR under Section 49.3 thereof, prescribes that pre-selection shall be based upon the capability and resources of the bidders to perform the contract taking into account their",

AFP Cyber Strategy. Circular nr 29 dated 06 December 2017, Subject: PN Cybersecurity Policy. 20 Critical Security Controls by SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security (SANS) Institute. 2. GENERAL: In order to reduce the ability of attackers to find and exploit unauthorized and unprotected systems, there is a need to use active monitoring, manage configuration and maintain an up-to-date inventory of devices connected to the enterprise network, including servers, workstations, laptops, and remote devices. Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all software on the network so that only authorized software is installed and can execute, and that unauthorized and unmanaged software is found and prevented from installation or execution. Maintaining inventories for hardware and software will identify vulnerable systems, detect malicious software, mitigate unpatched software, and root out attacks. PURPOSE: This SOP prescribes the general guidelines to units 6's and CEIS units for the inventory of Information Technology (IT) hardware and software SCOPE: This covers all PN Staff Officer for CEIS/C4ISR and PN CEIS units. DEFINITION OF TERMS: Asset - is any data, device, or other component of the environment that supports information-related activities. Assets generally include hardware (e.g. servers and switches), software (e.g. mission critical applications and support systems) and confidential information.

By strengthening their online defenses, internet users can be sure that their online information is secured. In the Philippine Navy, we may consider these useful tips from the Google for us and our family to be secured in using the Internet. Following are six (6) ways to a safer online experience: 1. Keep software up to date across devices, including mobile and desktop; 2. Use a unique password for every account. Think of it as having a different key to your front door, office and car. Passwords should be at least 8 characters long with numbers and special characters. Consider using a password manager; 3. Take the Security Checkup on your email account to spot possible unauthorized log-ins and access to your data; 4. Add a recovery phone number or email address to help you regain access to your account in case you can't sign in and keep these details updated. Some services use the recovery email to alert users on suspicious activity such as unauthorized logins; 5. Use 2-Step Verification to add another layer of security before accessing your account. This could come in the form of a code that is sent to a trusted device or a physical security key; and 6. For parents, teach your children about Internet safety. Google's Family Link allows users to manage their children's account settings and block certain apps and websites. ERIC E NICANOR COL PN(M)(GSC) AC of NS for C4ISR Systems, N6 ",

Formjacking is a term we use to describe the use of malicious JavaScript code to steal credit card details and other information from payment forms on the checkout web pages of e-commerce sites. Formjacking is not a new technique, but recent campaigns are interesting as they are large, sophisticated, and have increased dramatically since mid-August 2018. . How does formjacking work? When a customer of an e-commerce site clicks \"submit\" or its equivalent after entering their details into a website's payment form, malicious JavaScript code that has been injected there by the cyber criminals collects all entered information, such as payment card details and the user's name and address. This information is then sent to the attacker's servers. Attackers can then use this information to perform payment card fraud or sell these details to other criminals on the dark web. How big is this campaign? This is a significant and sustained campaign, with activity increasing substantially in the week of September 13 to 20. According to Symantec telemetry, since August 13 we have blocked 248,000 attempts at formjacking—almost a quarter of a million instances. However, more than one third of those blocks (36 percent) occurred from September 13 to 20, indicating that this activity is increasing. What types of businesses are these attacks targeting? As we can see from the publicly reported attacks, Mag",

Attackers might use MitM attacks to steal login credentials or personal information, spy on the victim, or sabotage communications or corrupt data. \"MITM attacks are a tactical means to an end,\" says Zeki Turedi, technology strategist, EMEA at CrowdStrike. \"The aim could be spying on individuals or groups to redirecting efforts, funds, resources, or attention.\" Though MitM can be protected against with encryption, successful attackers will either reroute traffic to phishing sites designed to look legitimate or simply pass on traffic to its intended destination once harvested or recorded, meaning detection of such attacks is incredibly difficult. How man-in-the-middle attacks work? MitM attacks consist of sitting between the connection of two parties and either observing or manipulating traffic. This could be through interfering with legitimate networks or creating fake networks that the attacker controls. Compromised traffic is then stripped of any encryption in order to steal, change or reroute that traffic to the attacker's destination of choice (such as a phishing log-in site). Because attackers may be silently observing or re-encrypting intercepted traffic to its intended source once recorded or edited, it can be a difficult attack to spot. \"These types of attacks can be for espionage or financial gain, or to just be disruptive,\" says Turedi. \"The damage caused can range from small to huge, depending on the attacker's goals and ability to cause misc",

The video platform has been criticized for censoring content that might offend governments in markets where it operates. In September 2019, The Guardian saw internal documents that instructed moderators to censor content that could anger the Chinese government, including mentions of Tiananmen Square or Tibetan Independence. In a statement, TikTok said that these policies were no longer in use as of May. In November, the US Senate held a hearing on technology and data security and invited representatives from major technology companies, including TikTok. TikTok declined to send a representative. Zhu said he planned to meet with lawmakers about their concerns over TikTok but then canceled the meetings. The lawmakers argued that because TikTok's parent company ByteDance is based in China, TikTok could be forced \"to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.\" The senators added in their October letter to the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire that \"there is no legal mechanism for Chinese companies to appeal if they disagree with a request.\" TikTok responded with a statement, saying that it stores all US user data in the United States and backs it up in Singapore. The TikTok refusal \"only underscores Senator Cotton's concerns that the company is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party and will not secure the rights and privacy of its American users,\" the Arkansas Republican's office said in a state",

The said glitch happened on Tuesday, 29 January 2019 and it said to be the personal information were sent to the wrong people. As a matter of compliance with regulatory requirements in the Data Privacy Act, the Globe Telecom has rectified the issue with affected customers on sending wrong confirmation receipt to another individual and reported the incident to the National Privacy Commission. In addition, the error was just a case of sending the data registration confirmation receipt to the wrong individual and was not sent collectively or as a group of data. AFFECTED SUBSCRIBERS The said issue affected prepaid subscribers registered to its On the List program, which enables them to avail tickets to concerts and Globe events. The Globe has immediately took down the registration site and notified all affected customers and the rest of its 60 million prepaid customers were not inconvenienced by the glitch. RECOMMENDATION All PN personnel or dependents who have subscribed to the \"On the List\" online program of Globe Telecoms are reminded to take precautionary measures while the incident is under investigation. Furthermore, those who may have been affected are advised to monitor their online and offline accounts for any unusual activity, to change passwords, and other means of identity verification, and to be careful of phishing attempts and other online risks.

The new malware is being used \"for phishing and remote access by #DPRK cyber actors to conduct illegal activity, steal funds & evade sanctions\" according to the information published by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Defense (DoD). U.S. Cyber Command has also uploaded five samples of the newly discovered malware variants onto the VirusTotal malware aggregation repository. Besides the malware samples shared by the U.S. Cyber Command, CISA has also published detailed malware analysis reports (MARs) on its website containing indicators of compromise (IOCs) and YARA rules for each of the detected samples. The cybersecurity agency also provides mitigation measures in the form of Snort rules, as well as recommendations for system owners and administrators to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. The MARs are issued to help network defenders detect and reduce exposure to HIDDEN COBRA malicious cyber activity as the United States government cybersecurity agencies refer to North Korean government malicious activity.

The solution can be highly useful to organizations, particularly during this COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, when many employees are forced to work from home. Researchers at CyberArk, a company that specializes in privileged access security solutions, discovered vulnerability related to how popular VTS passes authentication access tokens to an image file. An attacker can exploit this weakness to create a link or GIF image file that, when processed, it sends an authentication token to a server they control. In the case of links, the victim needs to click on the link, but in attacks involving GIF images, the victim simply needs to view the GIF image in the chat and their token is sent to the hacker. Once they have obtained the token, the attacker can use it to hijack the victim's account through the VTS Application Programming Interfaces (API). The attacker can use this method to read the user's messages, send messages on their behalf, create groups, add or remove users from a group, and change group permissions. However, there are certain prerequisites for the attack to work. First of all, when the victim sees the malicious GIF, their access token can only be sent to a subdomain (e.g. teams.microsoft.com), so the attacker somehow needs to hijack such a subdomain. Microsoft released a patch for this vulnerability earlier of April and ensured the public that the domains identified by CyberArk cannot be abused and says it has taken other measures to prevent exploitation.

The malware, which researchers at security firm Cybereason recently discovered and called EventBot, masquerades as a legitimate Android app — like Adobe Flash or Microsoft Word for Android — which exploits Android's in-built accessibility features to obtain deep access to the device's operating system. Once installed — either by an unsuspecting user or by a malicious person with access to a victim's phone — the EventBot-infected fake app quietly siphons off passwords for more than 200 banking and cryptocurrency apps — including PayPal, Coinbase, CapitalOne and HSBC — and intercepts and two-factor authentication text message codes. With a victim's password and two-factor code, the hackers can break into bank accounts, apps and wallets, and steal a victim's funds. \"The developer behind Eventbot has invested a lot of time and resources into creating the code, and the level of sophistication and capabilities is really high,\" Assaf Dahan, head of threat research at Cybereason, told TechCrunch. The malware quietly records every tap and key press, and can read notifications from other installed apps, giving the hackers a window into what's happening on a victim's device. At one point the malware's creators improved the encryption scheme it uses to communicate with the hackers' server, and included a new feature that can grab a user's device lock code, likely to allow the malware to grant itself higher privileges to the victim's device like payments and system settings.

These spam emails contain malicious Word documents that download and install the infection from a remote computer. According to Myonlinesecurity.co.uk, who discovered this campaign, a server that was previously distributing the Ursnif banking Trojan has now started pushing GandCrab Ransomware v5.1. BleepingComputer decided to take a look at the spam emails and the files being distributed so that you can see how this campaign works. As previously stated, this latest malspam campaign is pretending to be updated emergency exit maps for the recipient's building. These emails state that they are coming from Rosie L. Ashton and have a subject of \"Up to datе еmеrgеnсy еxit map\". Attached to these spam emails is a Word document titled Emergencyexitmap.doc as shown below. If the attachment is opened, the user will simply see a document with the text \"Emergency exit map\" and a prompt to enable content. If the user clicks on the Enable Content button, the Word macros will execute a PowerShell script that downloads and installs the GandCrab v5.1 Ransomware onto the computer. When defobfuscated, you can see that the macros download a file called putty.exe from http://cameraista.com/olalala/putty.exe and save it to C:\\Windows\\temp\\putty.exe. The putty.exe is then executed. The putty.exe executable is GandCrab 5.1 and will begin to encrypt the files on your computer. Like earlier variants, GandCrab continues to encrypt files and then append a random extension to their file name. While",

Introduction Almost by definition, a \"firewall\" provides a filter that incoming or outgoing packets must pass through. If the firewall does something beyond filtering, like checking against a restrictions list, that's great, but it's not necessarily the \"definition\" of a firewall's function. Firewalls essentially trap inbound or outbound packets, analyze them, and then either send them on their way or toss them out. Any one of these products may or may not suit your needs. Once you've got a handle on the issues, however, you should be able to do your own product elimination, simply by comparing functional specifications. PfSense is an open source operating system used to turn a computer into a firewall, router, or a variety of other application-specific network appliances. PfSense is a customized FreeBSD distribution based on the m0n0wall project, a powerful but light-weight firewall distribution. PfSense builds upon m0n0wall's foundation and takes its functionality several steps further by adding a variety of other popular networking services. At its most basic level, a pfSense machine can be used to replace the common home router when more functionality is desired. In more advanced configurations, pfSense can be used to establish a secure tunnel to a remote office (VPN), load-balance a web farm, or shape and prioritize all network traffic (Traffic Shaping) just to name a few example scenarios. There are literally hundreds of ways to configure and customize a pfSense installation. The core functionality of any firewall involves creating port forward and firewall security rules, and pfSense is no different. These core features, plus others,",

The acronyms SEM, SIM and SIEM have been sometimes used interchangeably. The segment of security management that deals with real-time monitoring, correlation of events, notifications and console views is commonly known as Security Event Management (SEM).

  "content": "Critical Security Controls Initial Assessment Tool (v7.0b),,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Instructions - Read me first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, \"The purpose for this tool is to provide organizations with a simple tool for performing an initial assessment of their information assurance maturity level based on the controls defined by the Critical Security Controls and the Council on Cybersecurity. Any questions about how this tool works or suggestions can be directed to info@auditscripts.com. In order to use this tool, the assessor must only complete the answers to the drop down menu questions lists on the pages labeled CSC #1 - CSC #20. By choosing a drop down choice for each critical control, the assessment tool will automatically generate scores and maturity level based on the answers to each question.

GENERAL: In order to reinforce efforts to address cyber-related issues and develop the AFP cyber defense capability, there is a need to determine first the current AFP cyber security posture. The best way to accomplish this is through the conduct of a Cyber Risk Assessment (CRA) among AFP units. However, a standard guide by means of a policy on CRA should, therefore, be at hand. The SANS Top 20 Critical Security Controls which is being used as a recommended set of actions for cyber defense that provide specific and actionable ways to stop today's most pervasive and dangerous attacks. The SANS Institute, together with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and other organizations, developed the 20 Critical Security Controls (CSC) for effective cyber defense as a response to the growing security threats.The Controls have best-in-class threat data and transform it into actionable guidance to improve individual and collective security in cyberspace. PURPOSE: This SOP prescribes general guidelines to units 6's and CEIS units in order to ensure cybersecurity AFP-wide. This SOP shall likewise, be the basis for unit Commanders, Heads/Chiefs of offices to determine the unit's cyber security posture. SCOPE: This covers all AFP Staff Officer for CEIS and AFP CEIS units. DEFINITION OF TERMS: a. Cyber – is a prefix for a term or the modifier of a compound word, rather than a stand-alone word which usually relates to electronic data processing, information technology, electronic communications or information and computer sys",

Any questions about how this tool works or suggestions can be directed to info@auditscripts.com. In order to use this tool, the assessor must only complete the answers to the drop down menu questions lists on the pages labeled CSC #1 - CSC #20. By choosing a drop down choice for each critical control, the assessment tool will automatically generate scores and maturity level based on the answers to each question. Based on the answers to each question, the dashboard worksheet will automatically populate with the overall maturity level scores for the organization as a whole. These scores can therefore be used to measure the organization's progress and what percentage of the Critical Security Controls they are currently following. Ideally in the long term organizations would deploy tools that would automate the collection of this information, but in the meanwhile, this tool can be used to help start the process of manually assessing the organization's maturity level.\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Field Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ID,,,This is the ID number of the specific critical security control sub-control reference as included in the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, Critical Security Control Detail,,,This is the detail behind each specific sub-control as defined by the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, EOF Function,,,\"This standards for \"\"Executive Order Framework (EOF)\"\" function.

No inventory of authorized and unauthorized devices Program for Asset Management System such as MS Active Directory 2. Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software Identify vulnerable or malicious software to mitigate or root out attacks: Devise a list of authorized software for each type of system, and deploy tools to track software installed (including type, version, and patches) and monitor for unauthorized or unnecessary software. 3. Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices, Laptop, Workstations, and Servers Prevent attackers from exploiting services and settings that allow easy access through networks and browsers: Build a secure image that is used for all new systems deployed to the enterprises, host these standard images on secure storage servers, regularly validate and update these configurations, and track system images in a configuration management system. 4. Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation Proactively identify and repair software vulnerabilities reported by security researchers or vendors: Regularly run automated vulnerability scanning tools against all systems and quickly remediate any vulnerabilities, which critical problems fixed within 48 hours. 5.

GENERAL: In order to reinforce efforts to address cyber-related issues and develop the PN cyber defense capability, there is a need to first determine the current PN cyber security posture. The best way to accomplish this is through the conduct of a Cyber Risk Assessment (CRA) among PN units. Thus, a standard guide by means of a policy on CRA should be at hand. The SANS Top 20 Critical Security Controls which is being used as a recommended set of actions for cyber defense that provide specific and actionable ways to stop today's most pervasive and dangerous attacks. The SANS Institute, together with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and other organizations, developed the 20 Critical Security Controls (CSC) for effective cyber defense as a response to the growing security threats. The Controls have best-in-class threat data and transform it into actionable guidance to improve individual and collective security in cyberspace. PURPOSE: This SOP prescribes the general guidelines to units 6's and CEIS units in order to provide adequate cybersecurity controls for the PN.

  "content": " LastActivityView v1.32 Copyright (c) 2012 - 2018 Nir Sofer Web site: http://www.nirsoft.net Description =========== LastActivityView is a tool for Windows operating system that collects information from various sources on a running system, and displays a log of actions made by the user and events occurred on this computer. The activity displayed by LastActivityView includes: Running .exe file, Opening open/save dialog-box, Opening file/folder from Explorer or other software, software installation, system shutdown/start, application or system crash, network connection/disconnection and more... You can easily export this information into csv/tab-delimited/xml/html file or copy it to the clipboard and then paste into Excel or other software. System Requirements =================== This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000 and up to Windows 10. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported. Known Limitations ================= This tool gathers information from various sources, including the Registry, the events log of Windows, the Prefetch folder of Windows (C:\\windows\\Prefetch), the MiniDump folder of Windows (C:\\Windows\\Minidump), and more... The accuracy and the availability of the information displayed by LastActivityView might be different from one system to another. For example, if the user or a software makes changes in the Registry, the action time displayed by LastActivityView might be wrong, because it's based on the modified time of some Registry keys. Also, for every type of action/event, there is some limitation according to the way that the information is saved in the system. For example, the 'Select file in open/save dialog-box' action is limited for one action of every file extension, so if the user opened 2 .doc files with the open/save dialog-box, only the last one will be displayed. Versions History ================ * Version 1.32: o Fix bug: On Windows 10/8 - In some folder names of 'View Folder in Explorer' items, Last",

Any questions about how this tool works or suggestions can be directed to info@auditscripts.com. In order to use this tool, the assessor must only complete the answers to the drop down menu questions lists on the pages labeled CSC #1 - CSC #20. By choosing a drop down choice for each critical control, the assessment tool will automatically generate scores and maturity level based on the answers to each question. Based on the answers to each question, the dashboard worksheet will automatically populate with the overall maturity level scores for the organization as a whole. These scores can therefore be used to measure the organization's progress and what percentage of the Critical Security Controls they are currently following. Ideally in the long term organizations would deploy tools that would automate the collection of this information, but in the meanwhile, this tool can be used to help start the process of manually assessing the organization's maturity level.\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Field Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ID,,,This is the ID number of the specific critical security control sub-control reference as included in the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, Critical Security Control Detail,,,This is the detail behind each specific sub-control as defined by the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, EOF Function,,,\"This standards for \"\"Executive Order Framework (EOF)\"\" function.

GENERAL: In order to reinforce efforts to address cyber-related issues and develop the AFP cyber defense capability, there is a need to determine first the current AFP cyber security posture. The best way to accomplish this is through the conduct of a Cyber Risk Assessment (CRA) among AFP units. However, a standard guide by means of a policy on CRA should, therefore, be at hand. The SANS Top 20 Critical Security Controls which is being used as a recommended set of actions for cyber defense that provide specific and actionable ways to stop today's most pervasive and dangerous attacks. The SANS Institute, together with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and other organizations, developed the 20 Critical Security Controls (CSC) for effective cyber defense as a response to the growing security threats.The Controls have best-in-class threat data and transform it into actionable guidance to improve individual and collective security in cyberspace. PURPOSE: This SOP prescribes general guidelines to units 6's and CEIS units in order to ensure cybersecurity AFP-wide. This SOP shall likewise, be the basis for unit Commanders, Heads/Chiefs of offices to determine the unit's cyber security posture. SCOPE: This covers all AFP Staff Officer for CEIS and AFP CEIS units. DEFINITION OF TERMS: a.

Any questions about how this tool works or suggestions can be directed to info@auditscripts.com. In order to use this tool, the assessor must only complete the answers to the drop down menu questions lists on the pages labeled CSC #1 - CSC #20. By choosing a drop down choice for each critical control, the assessment tool will automatically generate scores and maturity level based on the answers to each question. Based on the answers to each question, the dashboard worksheet will automatically populate with the overall maturity level scores for the organization as a whole. These scores can therefore be used to measure the organization's progress and what percentage of the Critical Security Controls they are currently following. Ideally in the long term organizations would deploy tools that would automate the collection of this information, but in the meanwhile, this tool can be used to help start the process of manually assessing the organization's maturity level.\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Field Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ID,,,This is the ID number of the specific critical security control sub-control reference as included in the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, Critical Security Control Detail,,,This is the detail behind each specific sub-control as defined by the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, EOF Function,,,\"This standards for \"\"Executive Order Framework (EOF)\"\" function.

Any questions about how this tool works or suggestions can be directed to info@auditscripts.com. In order to use this tool, the assessor must only complete the answers to the drop down menu questions lists on the pages labeled CSC #1 - CSC #20. By choosing a drop down choice for each critical control, the assessment tool will automatically generate scores and maturity level based on the answers to each question. Based on the answers to each question, the dashboard worksheet will automatically populate with the overall maturity level scores for the organization as a whole. These scores can therefore be used to measure the organization's progress and what percentage of the Critical Security Controls they are currently following. Ideally in the long term organizations would deploy tools that would automate the collection of this information, but in the meanwhile, this tool can be used to help start the process of manually assessing the organization's maturity level.\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Field Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ID,,,This is the ID number of the specific critical security control sub-control reference as included in the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, Critical Security Control Detail,,,This is the detail behind each specific sub-control as defined by the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, EOF Function,,,\"This standards for \"\"Executive Order Framework (EOF)\"\" function.

Operational procedure and method of testing and evaluation are explained to measure its effectiveness based on predefined parameters. Project Design The Cryptographic Instant Messaging (CIM) system is Instant Messaging (IM) application software that provides encrypted chat communication and file transfer for secure and reliable exchange of information. Figure 2. Interface Diagram of CIM IM Relay Server INTERNET Encrypt Decrypt Receive Send Client X Client Y 1588081911698 28 Operational Concept and Dataflow Figure 2 from the previous page illustrates the fundamental structure of the system and flow of data from an end-user's perspective. Client X initiates a chat conversation with Client Y using the CIM client software. During the chat conversation, the system automatically encrypts the text message prior sending it to the IM Relay Server. The server now searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server transmits the encrypted text message to Client Y (recipient) through its socket. The server manages all clients' sockets. It handles authentication of all incoming clients prior acceptance of the socket. IM Relay Server maintains a minimal database using MS SQL Server, SQL Express, or MS Access for accounts and activity logs. As soon as the text message arrived at Client Y (recipient), the software then decrypts the text using the system-generated key as the default. Unreadable message or randomized characters indicates unmatched passkey. Both Client X (sender) and Client Y (recipient) must encode manually the correct or agreed passkey to decode their conversation. The manual encoding of a passkey is done to deny the system administrator or any authority from decoding the message during the conduct of any special investigation. System generated key",

It explores the earlier developments, previous research, and existing technologies leading to the development of a prototype cryptographic IM (CIM). It includes the operational definition of terms used, and the conceptual framework to visually synthesize all materials and techniques in achieving the desired objective. Review of Related Literature and Studies Historical Development of Instant Messaging (IM) The advent of Instant Messenger like Facebook Messenger, Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other popular IM revolutionizes the way people communicate with each other. But its impressive features would not be possible without the earlier breakthrough of their predecessors. Desjardin (2016), in his article \"The Evolution of Instant Messaging\", narrates the written accounts that brought the IM and how it grows prominence in the new era. Instant Messaging became known in the 1990's but decades ago Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) already demonstrated an information sharing program called Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). In 1988, Jarkko Oikarinen developed the first chat system that allows sending messages to users through their computers (Oikarinen, 1988). His Internet Relay Chat (IRC) paved the way for other IM players like AOL IM, ICQ, and Microsoft IRC to battle for share in the IM market. Yahoo messenger 7 dominates in 1998 with its intuitive designs and feature-rich IM environment. Engel (2014) recounts how IM grow prominence in the 2000s. This was the golden age of instant messenger. MSN Messenger introduced the concept of sharing photos and included the PC-to-PC and PC-to-phone audio capabilities. Skype Messenger peaked in popularity in 2003 as it showcased Audio and Video chat capabilities. Facebook chat was first introduced in 2008 and accelerated its popularity in 2014 when it decouples from the Facebook",

  "content": "The original 1970 US tinda muta release of The Man Who Sold the World employed a cartoon-like cover drawing by Bowie's friend Michael J. Weller, featuring a cowboy in front of the Cane Hill mental asylum.[16] Weller, whose friend was a patient there, suggested the idea after Bowie had asked him to create a design that would capture the music's foreboding tone. Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John Wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten-gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risqué and the balloon was left blank. According to Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg, \"at this point, David's intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's Metropolis: the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man Who Sold the World.\"[4] Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance.[4] The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish.[17] It has been said that his \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo, were inspired by",

Project description, project structure, and the capabilities and limitations are brie y discussed to elucidate the nished project. The result of the evaluation and its interpretation was also presented in this chapter. Project Description The Cryptographic IM (CIM) system is an instant messaging application that allows data communication among peers. It provides essential features for of ce collaboration such as one-to-one chat, group chat, le transfer, and others. Multi-layered encryption is integrated into the CIM to provide greater security. Advanced Encryption Standard (ABS) and the Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm encrypts the data as it traverses across the network. The system was developed in modules or components making it agile in any type of deployment. Meaning, the CIM can be deployed even without the other modules if it is not required for a particular deployment. There are three (3) modules developed, the base, le transfer, and the encryption module. The base component provides the platform for the two (2) components and other future components to be integrated into. These future components can also be a third-party DLL, API, or SDK. ",

It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user- friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-Way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their ofďŹce communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making.

  "content": "Chapter 1 `INTRODUCTION Background of the Study Data exchange or data communication is a key process of providing accurate and timely information to senior leaders, top management, and decision makers. It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user-friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their office communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making. In today's network-centric operation, Instant Messaging (IM) is an essential information communication tool for rapid delivery of messages and reports, and for situational awareness. The US military has long been using IM for its military operations. In fact, Cummings (2004, p. 654) stated that \"it was the primary means of communication between navy ships during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003\".

It explores the earlier developments, previous research, and existing technologies leading to the development of a prototype cryptographic IM (CIM). It includes the operational definition of terms used, and the conceptual framework to visually synthesize all materials and techniques in achieving the desired objective. Review of Related Literature and Studies Historical Development of Instant Messaging (IM) The advent of Instant Messenger like Facebook Messenger, Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other popular IM revolutionizes the way people communicate with each other. But its impressive features would not be possible without the earlier breakthrough of their predecessors. Desjardin (2016), in his article \"The Evolution of Instant Messaging\", narrates the written accounts that brought the IM and how it grows prominence in the new era. Instant Messaging became known in the 1990's but decades ago Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) already demonstrated an information sharing program called Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). In 1988, Jarkko Oikarinen developed the first chat system that allows sending messages to users through their computers (Oikarinen, 1988). His Internet Relay Chat (IRC) paved the way for other IM players like AOL IM, ICQ, and Microsoft IRC to battle for share in the IM market. Yahoo messenger dominates in 1998 with its intuitive designs and feature-rich IM environment. Engel (2014) recounts how IM grow prominence in the 2000s. This was the golden age of instant messenger. MSN Messenger introduced the concept of sharing photos and included the PC-to-PC and PC-to-phone audio capabilities. Skype Messenger peaked in popularity in 2003 as it showcased Audio and Video chat capabilities. Facebook chat was first introduced in 2008 and accelerated its popularity in 2014 when it decouples from the Facebo",

Interface Diagram of CIM Operational Concept and Dataflow Figure 2 from the previous page illustrates the fundamental structure of the system and flow of data from an end-user's perspective. Client X initiates a chat conversation with Client Y using the CIM client software. During the chat conversation, the system automatically encrypts the text message prior sending it to the IM Relay Server. The server now searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server transmits the encrypted text message to Client Y (recipient) through its socket. The server manages all clients' sockets. It handles authentication of all incoming clients prior acceptance of the socket. IM Relay Server maintains a minimal database using MS SQL Server, SQL Express, or MS Access for accounts and activity logs. As soon as the text message arrived at Client Y (recipient), the software then decrypts the text using the system-generated key as the default. Unreadable message or randomized characters indicates unmatched passkey. Both Client X (sender) and Client Y (recipient) m",

  "content": "WHITE PAPER The Three Principles of Data Center Infrastructure Design The Three Principles of Data Center Infrastructure Design Understand These Three Principles and You'll: Lower your total cost of ownership Support your future growth plans Reduce your risk of downtime Maximize performance Improve your ability to reconfigure Your data center is the most critical resource within your organization. As you know, it provides the means for all storage, management and dissemination of data, applications and communications for your business. When employees and customers are unable to access the servers, storage systems and networking devices that reside in the data center, your entire organization can shut down. Millions of dollars can be lost in a matter of minutes for businesses like banks, airlines, shipping facilities and online brokerages. Faced with these consequences, IT executives today must optimize their data centers, particularly the network infrastructure. When you consider that 70 percent of network downtime can be attributed to physical layer problems, specifically cabling faults, it's paramount that more consideration be given to infrastructure design. Within this white paper we introduce three principles, that when executed properly, will help you gain significant benefits and savings throughout the life of your data center. Page The Three Principles of Data Center Design When you understand the three principles of data center design, you are able to: Lower your total cost of ownership Support your future growth plans Reduce your risk of downtime Maximize performance Improve your ability to reconfigure Principle 1: Space Savings Environmentally controlled real estate is expensive. The cost of building a data center is more than $1,000 per square foot in some cases (see Table 1). Data center racks and equipment can take up an enormous amount of real estate, and the future demand for more network connections, bandwidth and storage may require even more space",

Back sometime in May of 2013, the government websites of the Philippines are being taken down by \"Taiwanese\" keyboard warriors following the taiwanese fishermen incident, serving as payback. The Philippines is now taking a step towards safeguarding its digital network or the cyberspace. The digital world is becoming more and more vulnerable. As much as great inventions and technologies empower us, these pose real threats and can lead to unprecedented damage. Inadequate response to these incidents may result to national crisis. Statistics are truly alarming. Each minute somewhere around the world a cyberattack is being performed. Literally this very second, someone's computer is being hacked, someone's personal records, financial information, or intellectual property is being stolen and sold on the black market. The Philippine Military is no exception to this. Everyday your Philippine Navy experiences numerous cyber-attacks in an attempt to penetrate our network and some get through by means of inadvertent downloads and USB insertion. Criminals are stepping up their game and data breaches are increasingly common and devastating. That is why we need to act together – Government agencies, Private Sectors, NGO, Academe, and even households with internet connections. With that, Thank You at Mabuhay po tayong lahat! ",

Part of MISLATEL is China Telecoms, a state-sponsored corporation. MISLATEL offers the lowest bid in providing internet and IP VPN services to some government agencies, to include the Philippine Navy. At present, the current internet and IP VPN services provided by PLDT is less viable in terms of technological and financial concerns that led to the termination of contract of PLDT. By 2020, the PN open the bidding to the 3 Telco and subsequently, MISLATEL was awarded the contract to provide the internet and IP VPN services. Some secured networks of the PN, especially the VPN, are passing through the MISLATEL routing nodes that uses China software. Because of these, threat on cyber security is perceived to be eminent. Assumption: MISLATEL VPN AFP Cyber breach using Huawei Tech National ID System CCTV Scenario: Due to the implementation of the National ID system, all crucial information to include the biometrics and iris scan of all PN personnel were registered already. Also, the CCTV project of DILG pushed-through and the full implementation covers the integration of the entire system of CCTV within Metro Manila where the seat of the government lies. Subsequently, MISLATEL were indicted that there were solid evidences proving the allegations that billions of data were being sent from every China ICT equipment routing nodes back to Beijing, China. Intelligence report, also, states that a group of CH Hackers claimed to be working with Chinese government facilitating the volumes of data traffic to Beijing.

Any questions about how this tool works or suggestions can be directed to info@auditscripts.com. In order to use this tool, the assessor must only complete the answers to the drop down menu questions lists on the pages labeled CSC #1 - CSC #20. By choosing a drop down choice for each critical control, the assessment tool will automatically generate scores and maturity level based on the answers to each question. Based on the answers to each question, the dashboard worksheet will automatically populate with the overall maturity level scores for the organization as a whole. These scores can therefore be used to measure the organization's progress and what percentage of the Critical Security Controls they are currently following. Ideally in the long term organizations would deploy tools that would automate the collection of this information, but in the meanwhile, this tool can be used to help start the process of manually assessing the organization's maturity level.\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Field Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ID,,,This is the ID number of the specific critical security control sub-control reference as included in the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, Critical Security Control Detail,,,This is the detail behind each specific sub-control as defined by the Critical Security Controls documentation.,,,,,,,,,,,, EOF Function,,,\"This standards for \"\"Executive Order Framework (EOF)\"\" function.

Under Section 49 of RA 9184 and its revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), it may be employed under any of the following conditions: (1) procurement of highly specialized types of goods (e.g., sophisticated defense equipment, complex air navigation systems, coal) and consulting services where only a few suppliers or consultants are known to be available, such that resorting to the public bidding method will not likely result in any additional suppliers or consultants participating in the bidding; or (2) procurement of major plant components where it is deemed advantageous to limit the bidding to known qualified bidders in order to maintain uniform quality and performance of the plant as a whole. Section 49.2 of the IRR of RA 9184 provides that the pre-selected suppliers or consultants shall be those appearing in a list maintained by the relevant government authority that has expertise in the type of procurement concerned. The list of pre-selected suppliers or consultants shall be updated periodically. A copy of the list shall be submitted to, and maintained updated with, the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB). In addition, the IRR under Section 49.3 thereof, prescribes that pre-selection shall be based upon the capability and resources of the bidders to perform the contract taking into account their",

PURPOSE: The purpose of this SOP is to provide guidance to Philippine Navy units/offices to ensure compliances with minimally acceptable system configuration requirements as determined by the organization within the information security standards and best practices. Furthermore, this SOP shall provide guidance to PN units/offices to develop fixed reference in the development cycle or an agreed-upon specification of information systems. PN shall develop baseline configuration that shall serve as a documented basis for defining incremental change and encompasses many different aspects of the information systems. The baseline configuration shall be the center of the effective configuration management program whose purpose is to give definite basis for change control in a project by controlling various configuration items like work, features, system performance and other measurable configuration, which is basically defined specification that is considered the baseline for all changes that follow. In addition, this SOP is important process for establishing and maintaining secure information system configurations and provides important support for managing security risks in information systems. This SOP supports the policy and guidelines of the PN Cybersecurity Policy and adopted the National Institute for Standards and Technology Special Publication (NIST-SP) 800-53 for Configuration Management (CM) wherein the controls under the said publication were mapped in ISO/IEC 27001 for Information technology–Security Techniques–Information Security Management Systems–Requirements. 2.

Maligro attended the product presentation of IELTA on 211300H November 2017 at the Manila Peninsula Hotel, Makati City. The proponent presented the Conceptus System, a social media and web intelligence platform. The following are salient features of the system: Passive intelligence collection from social media and the web through creation of a seemingly legit social media personality (Avatar) that will blend in with the group or person of interest (POI); Crawls social media, deep web, darknet and bitcoin websites to collect valuable intelligence information about the POI; Generates actionable recommendation to grow and improve the avatar's reputation; and Correlates information from bitcoin transactions to provide further insights into the identity of the POI. While similar products, like the Knowlesys, have already been introduced to the PN, this branch is unable to determine the value and cost-benefit analysis of the system since this is a tool for Intelligence gathering. As such, we shall forward its brochure and other pertinent information to the TIG, NISF for their evaluation. For information of the AC of NS for C4ISR Systems.

Based on the assessment of the actual inventory and specifications of these computers, several desktops and laptops are obsolete and can no longer support the installation of the latest software specifically the Microsoft Windows 10 Pro operating system. Hence, the NICTC recommends the procurement of software licenses only to computers that meets the minimum requirements for Windows 10 and further recommends the replacement of the obsolete computers with desktops and laptops bundled with Windows 10 pro. Relatedly, the NICTC facilitated the procurement and installation of software licenses for some PN units through the previous fund releases (ref 1b). After assessment on the actual inventory of the remaining unlicensed computers (windows 10 compatible), the NICTC identifies the total number of required software licenses for the twenty two (22) PN units. Moreover, It was discussed during the conference (ref 1b) that only the software requirements shall be requested from the 2018 residual fund while the hardware shall be programmed f",

Accessing, possessing, and distribution of digital content pertaining to frogs breaches both civil and criminal laws. Jack has also been accused by NRTDC of obtaining two highly confidential documents. One document encompasses the names, position, usernames and password of notable personnel within the company. The second company is a top secret technology invention report wherein Jack should not have had access to either of these documents. As a consultant who specialized in Digital Forensics investigation, I am tasked to examine an image of Jack's laptop which was seized with the appropriate warrants. An image of the hard disk was created using forensically sound practices. Only a logical acquisition was undertaken by the individual responsible for creating the forensic copy. The logical acquisition was undertaken in a forensically sound manner and the md5 value at the same time of acquisition was \"a72a04e309dc8aa20345db1e2ba4cd61\". To start the investigation, the examiner Samsung Ativ 7 Core i5 laptop to investigate the downloaded image of Jack Daniels hard disk through the use of the following applications; OSMount, OSForensics, Autopsy, Passware Password Recovery Kit Forensic and Truecrypt. With the use of OSForensics and Autopsy Tools, the examiner investigate, exploit and explore the recent activity made by Jack Daniel to the computer. Manually browsing and/or auto search was also conducted using both software to search any suspicious file specifically frogs that has been accessed by Jack Daniel to his laptop. After thorough search and analyzation, fifteen (15) frogs were located to different folder locations. Said files extensions were change intentionally by Jack Daniel to avoid easy detection a",

The new malware is being used \"for phishing and remote access by #DPRK cyber actors to conduct illegal activity, steal funds & evade sanctions\" according to the information published by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Defense (DoD). U.S. Cyber Command has also uploaded five samples of the newly discovered malware variants onto the VirusTotal malware aggregation repository. Besides the malware samples shared by the U.S. Cyber Command, CISA has also published detailed malware analysis reports (MARs) on its website containing indicators of compromise (IOCs) and YARA rules for each of the detected samples. The cybersecurity agency also provides mitigation measures in the form of Snort rules, as well as recommendations for system owners and administrators to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. The MARs are issued to help network defenders detect and reduce exposure to HIDDEN COBRA malicious cyber activity as the United States government cybersecurity agencies refer to North Korean government malicious activity.

These spam emails contain malicious Word documents that download and install the infection from a remote computer. According to Myonlinesecurity.co.uk, who discovered this campaign, a server that was previously distributing the Ursnif banking Trojan has now started pushing GandCrab Ransomware v5.1. BleepingComputer decided to take a look at the spam emails and the files being distributed so that you can see how this campaign works. As previously stated, this latest malspam campaign is pretending to be updated emergency exit maps for the recipient's building. These emails state that they are coming from Rosie L. Ashton and have a subject of \"Up to datе еmеrgеnсy еxit map\". Attached to these spam emails is a Word document titled Emergencyexitmap.doc as shown below. If the attachment is opened, the user will simply see a document with the text \"Emergency exit map\" and a prompt to enable content. If the user clicks on the Enable Content button, the Word macros will execute a PowerShell script that downloads and installs the GandCrab v5.1 Ransomware onto the computer. When defobfuscated, you can see that the macros download a file called putty.exe from http://cameraista.com/olalala/putty.exe and save it to C:\\Windows\\temp\\putty.exe. The putty.exe is then executed. The putty.exe executable is GandCrab 5.1 and will begin to encrypt the files on your computer. Like earlier variants, GandCrab continues to encrypt files and then append a random extension to their file name. While",

Formjacking is a term we use to describe the use of malicious JavaScript code to steal credit card details and other information from payment forms on the checkout web pages of e-commerce sites. Formjacking is not a new technique, but recent campaigns are interesting as they are large, sophisticated, and have increased dramatically since mid-August 2018. . How does formjacking work? When a customer of an e-commerce site clicks \"submit\" or its equivalent after entering their details into a website's payment form, malicious JavaScript code that has been injected there by the cyber criminals collects all entered information, such as payment card details and the user's name and address. This information is then sent to the attacker's servers. Attackers can then use this information to perform payment card fraud or sell these details to other criminals on the dark web. How big is this campaign? This is a significant and sustained campaign, with activity increasing substantially in the week of September 13 to 20. According to Symantec telemetry, since August 13 we have blocked 248,000 attempts at formjacking—almost a quarter of a million instances. However, more than one third of those blocks (36 percent) occurred from September 13 to 20, indicating that this activity is increasing. What types of businesses are these attacks targeting? As we can see from the publicly reported attacks, Mag",

Attackers might use MitM attacks to steal login credentials or personal information, spy on the victim, or sabotage communications or corrupt data. \"MITM attacks are a tactical means to an end,\" says Zeki Turedi, technology strategist, EMEA at CrowdStrike. \"The aim could be spying on individuals or groups to redirecting efforts, funds, resources, or attention.\" Though MitM can be protected against with encryption, successful attackers will either reroute traffic to phishing sites designed to look legitimate or simply pass on traffic to its intended destination once harvested or recorded, meaning detection of such attacks is incredibly difficult. How man-in-the-middle attacks work? MitM attacks consist of sitting between the connection of two parties and either observing or manipulating traffic. This could be through interfering with legitimate networks or creating fake networks that the attacker controls. Compromised traffic is then stripped of any encryption in order to steal, change or reroute that traffic to the attacker's destination of choice (such as a phishing log-in site). Because attackers may be silently observing or re-encrypting intercepted traffic to its intended source once recorded or edited, it can be a difficult attack to spot. \"These types of attacks can be for espionage or financial gain, or to just be disruptive,\" says Turedi. \"The damage caused can range from small to huge, depending on the attacker's goals and ability to cause misc",

The video platform has been criticized for censoring content that might offend governments in markets where it operates. In September 2019, The Guardian saw internal documents that instructed moderators to censor content that could anger the Chinese government, including mentions of Tiananmen Square or Tibetan Independence. In a statement, TikTok said that these policies were no longer in use as of May. In November, the US Senate held a hearing on technology and data security and invited representatives from major technology companies, including TikTok. TikTok declined to send a representative. Zhu said he planned to meet with lawmakers about their concerns over TikTok but then canceled the meetings. The lawmakers argued that because TikTok's parent company ByteDance is based in China, TikTok could be forced \"to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.\" The senators added in their October letter to the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire that \"there is no legal mechanism for Chinese companies to appeal if they disagree with a request.\" TikTok responded with a statement, saying that it stores all US user data in the United States and backs it up in Singapore. The TikTok refusal \"only underscores Senator Cotton's concerns that the company is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party and will not secure the rights and privacy of its American users,\" the Arkansas Republican's office said in a state",

The malware, which researchers at security firm Cybereason recently discovered and called EventBot, masquerades as a legitimate Android app — like Adobe Flash or Microsoft Word for Android — which exploits Android's in-built accessibility features to obtain deep access to the device's operating system. Once installed — either by an unsuspecting user or by a malicious person with access to a victim's phone — the EventBot-infected fake app quietly siphons off passwords for more than 200 banking and cryptocurrency apps — including PayPal, Coinbase, CapitalOne and HSBC — and intercepts and two-factor authentication text message codes. With a victim's password and two-factor code, the hackers can break into bank accounts, apps and wallets, and steal a victim's funds. \"The developer behind Eventbot has invested a lot of time and resources into creating the code, and the level of sophistication and capabilities is really high,\" Assaf Dahan, head of threat research at Cybereason, told TechCrunch. The malware quietly records every tap and key press, and can read notifications from other installed apps, giving the hackers a window into what's happening on a victim's device. At one point the malware's creators improved the encryption scheme it uses to communicate with the hackers' server, and included a new feature that can grab a user's device lock code, likely to allow the malware to grant itself higher privileges to the victim's device like payments and system settings.

The solution can be highly useful to organizations, particularly during this COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, when many employees are forced to work from home. Researchers at CyberArk, a company that specializes in privileged access security solutions, discovered vulnerability related to how popular VTS passes authentication access tokens to an image file. An attacker can exploit this weakness to create a link or GIF image file that, when processed, it sends an authentication token to a server they control. In the case of links, the victim needs to click on the link, but in attacks involving GIF images, the victim simply needs to view the GIF image in the chat and their token is sent to the hacker. Once they have obtained the token, the attacker can use it to hijack the victim's account through the VTS Application Programming Interfaces (API). The attacker can use this method to read the user's messages, send messages on their behalf, create groups, add or remove users from a group, and change group permissions. However, there are certain prerequisites for the attack to work. First of all, when the victim sees the malicious GIF, their access token can only be sent to a subdomain (e.g. teams.microsoft.com), so the attacker somehow needs to hijack such a subdomain. Microsoft released a patch for this vulnerability earlier of April and ensured the public that the domains identified by CyberArk cannot be abused and says it has taken other measures to prevent exploitation.

The PN Controlled Open Public Network or Gray network, where the regular internet services run and the PN Closed Network or Red Network wherein critical information systems services are connected. The current thrust of the General Headquarters is to enhance the AFP Wide Area Network by integrating the heterogeneous networks of the GHQ, Unified Commands, and Major services such as the PN Red Network into a robust, secured and resilient AFP Closed Network as mandated in Letter Directive Nr 65 (Enhancement of the AFP Network Connectivity, Security and Administration). Said letter directive requires to take the role in cybersecurity by protecting and securing the PN infostructure. In line with this, monitoring of traffic and endpoint devices at the PN Closed Network is important to ensure security and resiliency of the PN Infostructure.  Furthermore, the PN Gray Network provides connectivity with other government agencies, commercial partners, and platforms or units not connected to the closed network for coordination, collaboration and information exchange. It is through this connectivity that the PN network is at high risks in information and operation security, because of its link to other external networks. In addition, with data leakage incidents that had happened in this network, this infrastructure is considered vulnerable. The adversaries exploited the aforesaid vulnerable network and exfiltrated classified information, hence this network needs to be protected, monitored, and assessed regularly.  In 2009, the Cyber Security Group was created to be the first Cyber security Group of the AFP. The said group was responsible on the detection, identification and determining the various forms ",

  "content": "09 January 2019 Nelson Maligro, ON6 Philippine Navy Via email: nelsonmaligro@gmail.com Dear Sir: Thank you for meeting with us last November 2018 to discuss your document management requirements. May we take this opportunity to summarize the Globodox DMS objectives discussed during the meeting: 1. To respond quickly to the search/retrieval of records. Globodox DMS provides several search methods including the retrieval of records by indices or by a document's content, very similar to how a search and retrieve is made in Yahoo or Google. 2. To demonstrate office efficiency. Retrieval of records can be by school name, by teacher's name such as last name, first name, middle name, locality, and other fields. FMWC would like to define. Globodox DMS provides simple and advance search functions. 3. To have a backup of records electronically. Electronic records (scanned civil registry images, Microsoft Office files, email, and other forms of electronic files) placed into Globodox DMS can be copied into external medias to serve as a backup of original paper and office records. 4. To maintain disaster recovery measures in times of fire, rain, and earthquakes. In case of disaster, Globodox DMS can utilize these external disks/CDs and recreate the server database for business continuity. Floro International Corporation Unit 717B, ACG Buding Shaw Boulevard, Wack Wack, Mandaluyong Phone 533-2584 Fax: 654-7215 email: floro@floro-intl.com www.floro-intl.com, www.digitizingdocuments.com 2000-001 5. To relieve employees from clerical activities such as searching, retrieving and printing. 6. To provide security of original documents. Paper documents do not need to be accessed, thereby minimizing loss or misfiled documents though the use of Globodox DMS. Moreover, minimizing the handling of paper documents minimizes the wear and tear caused by handling. 7. To provide transfer of technology to the employees of FMWC through training and implementation of the Globodox DMS system. We have ",

PN SOP nr 30 dated 09 Dec 2011, Subject: PN Website Management This pertains to the alleged website defacement of Naval Reserve Command which was reported in social media (Facebook) account of a certain Mr Art Samaniego Jr. on 102126H April 2019. Based on initial result of investigation, the hacker with pen name \"SIBAT\" was able to upload some files that could run commands in the server. The NRC website contains feature that allows uploading of photos however the programmer fails to secure this functionalities through validation of input that denies uploading of any files other than images. This vulnerability provided a means for the hacker to upload malicious files including the infamous \"sibat.html\". The following are the established facts of investigation: The NRC website is not actually defaced and the original homepage remains intact and unchanged. The attacker successfully uploaded the bragging \"Sibat.html\" page but failed to overwrite the \"index.php\" which is the homepage because of non-write privilege. Based on the review of logs, there is no evidence of database/records extraction. On 30 Oct 2018 the programmer/administrator of NRC website modified/updated the system which included the \"File Upload\" feature but failed to submit it for VAPT first. For information.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this policy is to provide an overarching governance and top-level guidance to ensure the resiliency and protection of Philippine Navy (PN) Information Infrastructures (Infostructure), National Security Systems (NSS), and information resources. This publication shall serve as a basis for the issuance of specific policies, procedures, and guidelines to effectively implement cybersecurity. In this context, the PN adopts the principles of Confidentiality by ensuring that information is accessible only to those who are authorized, Integrity by safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods, and Availability by ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated systems when required. It discusses the procedures to address the requirements of the cybersecurity framework enablers such as Policy, Technology, Awareness, and Mitigation that are mutually supporting each other to achieve credible defense cybersecurity posture as mentioned in the PN Cyberwarfare Doctrine. Per said doctrine, cybersecurity is a prelude to Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO). Any organization cannot engage in DCO without fortifying its cybersecurity capability first. 2. SCOPE: This policy provides guidance to administrators, maintainers, operators, and third party stakeholders of the NSS, PN C4ISTAR infrastructure, and PN Infostructure for effective administration, operations, maintenance, and security of C4ISR systems. 3.

Naval defense is a complex undertaking that entails detailed and deliberate planning. Today the Philippine Navy is facing two (2) major challenges concerning the defense of the Philippine archipelago. The first is the need to address the various maritime security concerns, which compels the Navy to focus not only on its military role but also on its constabulary duties. This places a significant strain on its currently available capabilities in taking on the latter role, at the cost of veering away from its core competency as a naval force. The second challenge is the maintenance of an appropriate force-mix of people, organization, equipment, and logistics that allows the naval force to accomplish national ends within a certain time frame and cost. This challenge involves key decisions on the size and shape of the current and future naval force required and the difficult strategic risk management efforts that goes with it. 1.1.2. The Philippines in the past three years has experienced giant strides in putting its maritime agenda in order. This was initially brought about by the passage of the amendments to the Philippine Baselines Law or Republic Act 9522. The law effectively set the national policy of aligning our national boundaries consistent with the UN Convention on the Law of Sea, eliminating strategic ambiguities with respect t",

For the past five years, the PN had experience various cyber incidents such as website defacement, denial of service, and data breach. The aforementioned incidents can be associated to the improper practices that users are committing. These may include, but not limited to, lack of policy and procedures on the use of USB or portable drivers, placements of the security devices and network monitoring systems, and licensing and updating of operating systems and application software. Related thereto, the Department of Information and Communication Technology (DICT) published the National Cyber Security Plan 2022 (ref a) that serves as the reference in developing methods and strategy in order to ensure resiliency of the government and private infostructure, which adopted the NIST Cybesecurity Framework. In addition, the AFP has issued guidance on the adoption of cyberspace as development of related policies, plans, program and strategies in the conduct of operations in the cyberspace domain. Further, the PN has approved the Cyber Warfare Doctrine (ref c) that provides general guidance and basic reference for PN commanders and staff on the principles and procedures on cyber defense, deterrence, and offense, which also adopted the framework of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity",

At the same time, we remained faithful to the practical spirit of policy change, recognizing that public expenditure management reforms are futile if they do not result in direct, immediate, and substantial benefits to the Philippines' poorest and most marginalized. The Organizational Performance Indicator Framework (OPIF) is a key reform of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) that seeks to implement effective agency spending to produce concrete and measurable outcomes in line with the Administration's priority development agenda. Under the OPIF, the deliverables of each department and agency go well beyond the number of roads builtor nurses hired, and are instead strategically designed to reduce poverty and induce all- inclusive growth. Together with other public expenditure management reforms—the Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) Approach, the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), the Procurement Reforms, and the strengthening of Internal Control Systems—the OPIF aims to ensure that each and every peso spent by the government is dedicated to the public good. To better inform the Congress and the public on the outputs required of every department and agency in exchange for their budget allocation, the DBM published this OPIF Book of Outputs for 2012. It serves as a practical reference tool for legislators, academics, students, civil society organizations and researchers, as well as oversight agencies. This Book of Outputs also allows the public to learn more about, understand, and monitor not only the peso values in the national budget,but more importantly, the performance of government agencies relative totheir mandates and budgetary allocations.

M Roxas Boulevard, Manila 11 Dec 2013 From: Flag Officer in Command, PN To: All PN Units Subj: Letter of Promulgation (Active Archipelagic Defense Strategy) 1. Introduction Our naval forces are currently facing the twin challenges of addressing the various maritime security concerns of our country while maintaining an appropriate force-mix of people, organization, equipment, and logistics that allow the naval force to accomplish national ends within a certain time frame and cost. Buoyed by the recent advancements in the development of legal and institutional policy frameworks on advancing our country's maritime interests such as the Philippine Baselines Law, Philippine Coast Guard Law, Amended AFP Modernization Law and Executive Order 57, the Philippine Navy as an institution has to collectively come up with the right direction of naval development. We need to take stock and reassess our role in the overall national defense and security architecture of our country in order to clearly identify the tasks that naval forces in the future must be able to accomplish, and what, and how much, of our core capabilities are required to accomplish these roles. These strategic level developments prompted the review of all existing PN strategies issued in the past with the hope of coming up with a new naval strategy using the communal thought and wisdom of our past and present officers and leaders. The promulgation of this Active Archipelagic Defense Strategy (AADS) encapsulates the tedious process of research, stakeholder consultations, and collective analysis. 2. On Naval Roles and Strategic Maritime Interests Culling altogether the materials from the Philippine Constitution of 1987 and policy issuances within the security sector and the Philippines, the principal tasks required of the Philippine Navy are as follows: a.

INTRODUCTION The Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) is a tool used to measure performance in the implementation of a particular plan/program/project. As an enhanced Logical Framework, it highlights the hierarchy of objectives with the corresponding sets of indicators and means of verifications at the impact, outcomes, outputs and inputs level as identified/established in the logical framework during the planning stage. Further, it contains the data collection strategy (which includes the how the data is to be collected, who will provide/collect it, and when it will be available and collected) and how these data are to be analyzed. II. Rationale and Objectives The Five Development Plans, namely: Executive-Legislative Agenda (ELA), Information Systems Strategic Plan (ISSP), Strategic Financial Management Plan (SFMP), Agusan del Sur Road Network Development Plan (ARNDP) and Human Resource Management Development Plan (HRMDP), were already in the implementation stage. These plans need to be monitored and evaluated in order to know the extent or degree of accomplishments in relation to their contribution to the achievement of the province vision to become \"an agri- industrialized, eco-tourism province of God-centered, caring, healthy, productive and self-sustaining communities\".

These underscored not only the ability and willingness of aggressor states to project power into those waters, but similarly the seemingly growing confidence to put Philippine Sovereignty to the test.

  "content": "Forcepoint Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Data protection in a zero-perimeter world 2 forcepoint.com Data security is a never-ending challenge. On one hand, IT organizations are required to keep up with regulations and protect intellectual property from targeted attacks and accidental exposure. On the other, they must adapt to macro IT movements, such as the adoption of cloud applications, hybrid cloud environments and BYOD trends, all of which increase the ways data can leave your organization. This expanding attack surface poses the most significant challenge to protecting critical data. Data security teams take the seemingly logical approach to chase data: find it, catalogue it and control it. Yet this traditional approach to data loss prevention is no longer effective because it ignores the biggest variable in data security — your people. Instead of focusing solely on data, security should begin and end with people. The key is to gain visibility into user interactions with data and applications. Once this is achieved, you can apply a level of control based on the specific user's risk and the sensitivity or value of the data. An organization's data protection program must consider the human point — the intersection of users, data and networks. In addition, the enterprise must remain vigilant of data as it moves across the enterprise and highlight the people who create, touch and move data. Secure regulated data with a single point of control for all the applications your people use to create, store and move data. Protect intellectual property with advanced DLP that analyzes how people use data, coaches your people to make good decisions with data and prioritizes incidents by risk. Cloud Applications (powered by Forcepoint CASB) Endpoint Network Discovery Forcepoint DLP Data protection must: Security driven by the human point Visibility & control everywhere your people work and date resides Forcepoint DLP addresses human-centric risk with visibility and control everyw",

Thank you again for considering Verint in the prestigious shortlist of Vendors to build the Navy SOC and Training facilities. Following the first submission of the response on Sep 29, 2019, the contenders have been given an updated set of requirement for the SOC and Training Facilities. After deep study of the technical and deliverables of the RFQ please see our response to each of the LOTs: SOC and Training technologies (LOT1): The updated list of requirements is richer and wider than the previous one. Among the observations are: 1. Request for high availability (including in the sites) which will increases the needed HW 2. Much wider Cyber Threat intelligence requirements that include unique additions. Among them are browser extension tools, sandboxing and SDK. 3. New chapter of Threat Vulnerability Management with inputs from systems such as Rapid7. 4. Much wider requests from the Cyber Range, EDR, SOAR and others 5. Request for Air Gap – which requires the usage of Diodes 6. The large amount of accessories mostly remains the same Therefore we would like to declare that in general outlines we are submitting the a proposal with November 7th, 2019 VERINT Systems Ltd. 33, Maskit St, Herzliya Pituach, Israel 46733 Office Fax: +972 9 962 4747 a similar scope as previously proposed in a design to budget approach, which in our opinion is the only way to provide a solution under the ABC.

  "content": "TECHNICAL DATASHEET Security Automation & Orchestration Review all security alerts, prioritize critical tasks, and remediate threats faster by automating security orchestration & incident response with Swimlane Automated Security Operations Despite investing heavily in a wide array of security solutions and the staff required to triage, investigate and resolve threats, information security organizations continue to struggle. Manual incident response processes, inefficient workflows and difficulty hiring and retaining qualified personnel leaves security teams struggling to keep up with an ever-increasing volume of alarms. Swimlane automates and orchestrates the incident response, collecting alert and event data from virtually any security platform with minimal effort. It automatically centralizes and responds to alerts using automated workflows to reduce mean time to detect and respond. Customizable, KPI-driven dashboards and reports deliver the intelligence necessary to drive continuous operational improvements and adaption to new threats. The Problem Organizations are losing the battle against cyber attackers. Overburdened security administrators are manually performing repetitive and time-consuming tasks to track, mitigate and resolve security events across multiple security platforms. But despite the time and effort, they can't analyze or adequately prioritize the security alerts and events necessary to protect their networks. And a lack visibility into their team's current activities, metrics, and performance leaves security managers struggling to justify additional resources. The Solution Swimlane's automated orchestration and workflow expedites the entire incident response management process, from initial event notification to remediation and closure. It automatically gathers key information, builds decision cases, and executes critical actions to prevent and/or remediate cyber threats based on logical incident response processes.

As such, each agency has an outsized threat profile and an ever- growing number of daily attacks. To counter these threats, this federal agency has a 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) with a large staff. They rely on dozens of point security systems as well as sophisticated SIEM and network security platforms. They are tasked with typical SOC functions like: Monitoring Looking for anomalous activity Malware alerts Basic intelligence gathering Forensic, end-point, and network investigations SIEM management Phishing PII & classified data spills Reporting THE CHALLENGE All of these point solutions and responsibilities generate tens of thousands of alerts every day. Prior to bringing on Swimlane, each alert had to be manually triaged and investigated. Much of the SOC's time was spent on rote manual tasks like cutting and pasting information to and from ticketing systems or manually searching for information stored on various separate databases. Staff was becoming simultaneously frazzled and bored with their jobs. In the meantime, the number of both false alarms and genuine threats kept increasing. As a government agency, it has a fixed headcount and could not just throw additional bodies at the problem. Eventually, the SOC simply would not be able to keep up with the ever-increasing number of both true threats and false alarms. \"We were paying a lot of money for high-level data entry people.",

  "content": "Real-Time Forensics Every day new threats are discovered, adding to the list of millions of known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). This presents organizations with two challenges: Evaluating newly identified threats to identify an existing breach Checking millions of IOCs daily to identify newly launched attacks The first challenge is especially critical. As new threats become known, organizations need to know if attackers have already targeted and breached their networks. This means being able to look over historical data going back 6 months or longer to identify potential breaches. The second challenge, checking millions of IOCs daily for new matches, addresses the need for organizations to maintain visibility into emerging threats to the network. Detecting New Threats To determine if their organization was breached, security teams must take new threat intelligence and find any matches against recorded network activity over months or even years. Anomali developed the Real-Time Forensics (RTF) technology to complete searches over vast quantities of historical data in seconds instead of hours/days. RTF is the foundation of Anomali Enterprise, providing security teams instant visibility across all historical data. Detecting Existing Threats Security teams are simultaneously charged with live monitoring their organization's health by comparing new traffic against known threats. Threat intelligence indicators can easily run into millions of indicators, each needing to be evaluated against internal log events. Anomali Enterprise is purpose-built to perform this massive scale intelligence matching, capable of processing millions of IOCs and billions of internal log entries. Positively identified \"indicators of interest\" are automatically fed to the SIEM for ongoing monitoring or blocking. Indicators can also be enriched or added to investigations in ThreatStream, Anomali's Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP). Security teams can easily collaborate leveraging Anomali Enterp",

  "content": "During the period in which these developments were occurring, I had returned from a scientific undertaking organized to explore the Nebraska badlands in the United States. In my capacity as Assistant Professor at the Paris Museum of Natural History, I had been attached to this expedition by the French government. After spending six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New York laden with valuable collections near the end of March. My departure for France was set for early May. In the meantime, then, I was busy classifying my mineralogical, botanical, and zoological treasures when that incident took place with the Scotia. I was perfectly abreast of this question, which was the big news of the day, and how could I not have been? I had read and reread every American and European newspaper without being any farther along. This mystery puzzled me. Finding it impossible to form any views, I drifted from one extreme to the other. Something was out there, that much was certain, and any doubting Thomas was invited to place his finger on the Scotia's wound. When I arrived in New York, the question was at the boiling point. The hypothesis of a drifting islet or an elusive reef, put forward by people not quite in their right minds, was completely eliminated. And indeed, unless this reef had an engine in its belly, how could it move about with such prodigious speed? Also discredited was the idea of a floating hull or some other enormous wreckage, and again because of this speed of movement. So only two possible solutions to the question were left, creating two very distinct groups of supporters: on one side, those favoring a monster of colossal strength; on the other, those favoring an \"underwater boat\" of tremendous motor power. Now then, although the latter hypothesis was completely admissible, it couldn't stand up to inquiries conducted in both the New World and the Old. That a private individual had such a mechanism at his disposal was less than probable. Where and when had he b",

  "content": "The year 1866 was marked by a bizarre development, an unexplained and downright inexplicable phenomenon that surely no one has forgotten. Without getting into those rumors that upset civilians in the seaports and deranged the public mind even far inland, it must be said that professional seamen were especially alarmed. Traders, shipowners, captains of vessels, skippers, and master mariners from Europe and America, naval officers from every country, and at their heels the various national governments on these two continents, were all extremely disturbed by the business. In essence, over a period of time several ships had encountered \"an enormous thing\" at sea, a long spindle-shaped object, sometimes giving off a phosphorescent glow, infinitely bigger and faster than any whale. The relevant data on this apparition, as recorded in various logbooks, agreed pretty closely as to the structure of the object or creature in question, its unprecedented speed of movement, its startling locomotive power, and the unique vitality with which it seemed to be gifted. If it was a cetacean, it exceeded in bulk any whale previously classified by science. No naturalist, neither Cuvier nor Lacépède, neither Professor Dumeril nor Professor de Quatrefages, would have accepted the existence of such a monster sight unseen -- specifically, unseen by their own scientific eyes. Striking an average of observations taken at different times -- rejecting those timid estimates that gave the object a length of 200 feet, and ignoring those exaggerated views that saw it as a mile wide and three long--you could still assert that this phenomenal creature greatly exceeded the dimensions of anything then known to ichthyologists, if it existed at all. Now then, it did exist, this was an undeniable fact; and since the human mind dotes on objects of wonder, you can understand the worldwide excitement caused by this unearthly apparition. As for relegating it to the realm of fiction, that charge had to be dropp",

Organizations seeking to protect their customers' identities, safeguard their intellectual property and avoid business disruption need to proactively monitor their environment so that they can rapidly detect threats and accurately respond before attackers are able to cause material damage. IBM QRadar® Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is designed to provide security teams with centralized visibility into enterprise-wide security data and actionable insights into the highest priority threats. As a first step, the solution ingests a vast amount of data throughout the enterprise to provide a comprehensive view of activity throughout on-premises and cloud-based environments. As data is ingested, QRadar applies real-time, automated security intelligence to quickly and accurately detect and prioritize threats. Actionable alerts provide greater context into potential incidents, enabling security analysts to swiftly respond to limit the attackers' impact. Unlike other solutions, only QRadar is purpose-built to address security use cases and intentionally designed to easily scale with limited customization effort required. Gain comprehensive, centralized visibility Enterprise networks can span across traditional on-premises IT, cloud-based and operational technology (OT) environments, all of which require some level of oversight to effectively protect assets, accurately detect threats and maintain compliance. Before security teams can start analyzing data to detect and manage threats, they must first have centralized visibility into disparate security data. QRadar enables organizations to gain centralized, comprehensive visibility into siloed environments by collecting, parsing and normalizing both log and flow data. Hig",

But the effect is limited. According to the report of the research institute, the number of data breaches from 2015 to 2016 has increased from 77,503 to 100,000. The security threats facing now are changing, and the definition and scope of the terminal are also expanding, which increased protection difficulty. Terminal type diversity: Terminal operating system or host operating system is constantly upgraded and localized. Need to adapt for more and more terminal environments and new implementation challenges. Attack methods diversity: The attack mode is changed from the original violent attack to more precise and concealed without a single virus or malware infection, but through a series of investigation, customization, injection. Ransomware code becomes the ultimate killer that can be embedded in any operating system or any business system. After being infected, it will have a greater impact on the business or economic loss. Venusense EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) is used as the new defense point in the endpoint security. The traditional passive defense mode is overthrown. Early analysis, early response, and precautionary protection should be in active way. Venusense EDR provide ultra-light client as the information collection sensor cooperated with high-performance analysis engine and detection algorithms to fully enhance the endpoint security and guarantee the self-adaptive security.

To promote such policy, the Act, along with its IRR, shall govern the processing of personal data by any natural or juridical person in the government or private sector, who must in turn establish policies and implement measures to guarantee the security of personal data under their control and/or custody. With the Data Privacy Act, other pertinent laws, and the principles of transparency, legitimate purpose, and proportionality as its backdrop, the Philippine Navy (PN) abides by this Manual in carrying out its mission. This is to ensure that personal data under its control remain safe and secured while being processed in the course of its key operations and processes. This Manual aims to inform PN personnel, dependents, and stakeholders of the organization's data protection and security measures, and to guide them in the exercise of their rights under the Data Privacy Act and other relevant regulations and policies.

For each scenario, the teams will submit a report of their accomplishments which will be evaluated and verified by the Attack Task Group (ATG) to determine the total points acquired by each team. Verification is performed in combination of automated and manual review of the reports and evidences presented. For automated evaluation by a computer program or script, the teams will be provided with a formatted template with clear specifications that must be strictly followed. No considerations are given for wrong specification of data that may be unreadable. Each scenario has unique set of objectives and, therefore, teams will have different ways of earning points. Capture the Flag Objective: Red teams compete to gather as many flags as possible from the various challenges given. Result: DICT wins with 1600 point followed by PAF with 1500 and CEISSAFP with 1300 points. Network Discovery Objective: Discover the network and come up with a network map. Each team will identify the hosts, its running services, network devices, and determine how they are connected to each other in the network. A reporting template is distributed for each team to fill-in with the required information. Result: The RESERVIST identified the most number of devices and came up with accurate map of the network. Website Hack Objectives: Hack into the Mock-up ID System Web Server and extract the database of personnel records. Result: The DICT was able to find the vulnerability of the ID System and was able to gain access to all web pages without going through the login page. Several files were extracted from the server. The vulnerability reveals that the web application is not employing session variables. A session is a mechanism to persist information across the different web pages to identify users as they ",

The enhancement of GIS is part of the deliverables for the MITHI-COP Project. Representatives from GeoData demonstrated how the recently upgraded GIS server can be customized to allow incident reporting for the PN. The Incident Map of the GIS is similar to the NORS requirement this office sought. The following are action items resolved from the discussion: Basic GIS training shall be conducted to provide end users with the fundamental concept of the GIS and its application to the PN. It is scheduled on Jan 23-25 2018; Following the basic training is a workshop to be facilitated by this office involving representatives from ON2, NISF, NOC, NFOC, NICTC, F6, MC2, and other participants who attended the basic training. They shall provide the necessary requirements as inputs to the NORS development. It is scheduled on the 29th of January; GeoData will then customize the built-in Incident Map of the GIS based from the consolidated requirement of NORS. This shall cover tailor-fitting indent report map for the operation centers, and customizing client-side GeoForm for the PN Units; Upon completion of the customized NORS-GIS application, end users and GIS operators shall be trained for the utilization of the NORS; Separate training shall be given to the administrator who will maintain the GIS and the NORS application.

BACKGROUND: The continuous evolution of the Philippine Navy Integrated Personnel Management System (PN-IPMS) comes with the delivery of more personnel-oriented services. This materialized with the launching of Integrated Personnel Management System version 2012, appropriately termed as IPMSv12 to refer to the year it was launched. With the official activation of the PN Payroll Module of the IPMSv12, the processing of personnel pay, allowances, collateral and other claims becomes faster, secured and with lesser effort. However, the accuracy of individual personnel records stored in the system is a critical requirement since it becomes the basis for all financial calculations for personnel services. In order to avoid erroneous and delayed payments, it is important to ensure the completeness and accuracy of individual personnel records in the system. Thus, the IPMSv12 must be recognized and utilized as the official personnel data repository system of the Philippine Navy in order to centralize the management of information. PERSONNEL RECORDS: Personnel records include but shall not be limited to all records in the individual Military Personnel File (201 File) such as the following: Personal Information Military Service History Previous assignments Additional/Special Duties Schooling Promotion/Demotion Leave Records Unit Adjutan",

NICTC will demonstrate these systems as proof of capability to provide records automation and message security during its launching on the 17th of January 2018. While several issues were raised during the discussion, the following items are resolved for the successful conduct of the demonstration and proper implementation of these information systems: NICTC will continue to push the major units to update the records in the IPMS as this problem intertwines other modules used by various stakeholder units resulting to underutilization and un-appreciation; Fund is now available for the procurement of computer hardware and other equipment to be utilized for the IPMS; (i-verify pa daw ito ni LCDR BERMEO sir) NICTC proposed to install the PNIX to all key officers in parallel to the POLARIS rather than depreciating the latter from the former; Statement of Service and Leave Balance will highlight the OTNA Records module during the demonstration. NICTC will look into the issue of duplication and fraudulent entry of IPMS data by malicious encoders through the audit logs of the system; and NICTC will develop another IPMS ",

To promote such policy, the Act, along with its IRR, shall govern the processing of personal data by any natural or juridical person in the government or private sector, who must in turn establish policies and implement measures to guarantee the security of personal data under their control and/or custody. With the Data Privacy Act, other pertinent laws, and the principles of transparency, legitimate purpose, and proportionality as its backdrop, the Philippine Navy (PN) abides by this Manual in carrying out its mission. This is to ensure that personal data under its control remain safe and secured while being processed in the course of its key operations and processes. This Manual aims to inform PN personnel, dependents, and stakeholders of the organization's data protection and security measures, and to guide them in the exercise of their rights under the Data Privacy Act and other relevant regulations and policies.

This information automatically enters into the lPMSv12 version of Statement of Service (S03) and Summary of Information (SOI) of personnel that are viewable at NPMC and OTNA and various PN Systems Portal Kiosks deployed at selected areas. On the other hand, the Phase 2 of the software’s implementation covering the 22 major units of the Navy started with the completion of the lPMSv12 Phase 2a Connectivity Project on 18 June 2013. Said connectivity provided the adjutants and admin personnel the capability to encode awards, assignment, reenlistment and leave orders issued by their respective units. This also allowed the major units to view PNCCS clearances, SOI, S08 and other reports generated by |PMSv12. The most important activity that must be done by the major unit is the rendering of change in personnel status through the Electronic Change in Personnel Status (eCH|PS) report in order to achieve secure, reliable and timely monitoring and accounting of personnel. Recently, the IPMS Center was launched to cater the editing of all personnel information on the system.

SITUATION: Smart phones are convenient and efficient means for Command and Control (C2) between the senior officers and the Headquarters Philippine Navy (HPN) thru the Fleet — Marine Collaboration Mobile Phone (FMCMP). These systems operate using the commercial telecommunication providers which makes them vulnerable to communication breaches and information leaks. On this, the Philippine Navy (PN) employed smart phones which are equipped with an encrypted short messaging (SMS) application to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of classified information. As a need for secured SMS, Secret Message Elite was adopted, however, appeared to have cut short of the growing demand for ease of employment and message size. Hence, the Naval Intelligence Security Force (NISF) initiated the development of a better alternative to the Secure Message Elite, the Polaris SMS. The said system was an android messaging application developed by TIG, NISF on December 2016 called “Polaris SMS”. It was developed to cater the needs of the NISFIPN Intel officesfunits for a more secured way of transmitting information through short messaging service using an open source code. In this connection, the Naval Information and Communications Technology Center (NICTC) were tasked to conduct assessment, validation and corrective measure on the said system prior deployment for PN wide use. However, due to none availability of source code from NISF as reference and basis of enhancement, the center shall developlprogram and deploy new systems application similar to Polaris SMS (enhanced and secured version of Polaris SMS) to be deployed to PN wide NLT 01 June 2017. ll.

Based on the assessment of the actual inventory and specifications of these computers, several desktops and laptops are obsolete and can no longer support the installation of the latest software specifically the Microsoft Windows 10 Pro operating system. Hence, the NICTC recommends the procurement of software licenses only to computers that meets the minimum requirements for Windows 10 and further recommends the replacement of the obsolete computers with desktops and laptops bundled with Windows 10 pro. Relatedly, this office included the acquisition of several desktop computers in the PN Information Systems Strategic Plan (ISSP) 2019-2021 which was evaluated, reviewed, and endorsed last 02 February 2018 by the DICT (ref 1c).

Likewise, this document provides direction to the members of the Defense Acquisition System Assessment Team (DASAT), DAS Technical Working Group (TWG)/Project Management Team (PMT), Technical Inspection and Acceptance Committee (TIAC), and all PN units and personnel who are directly or indirectly involved in handling, supervising, monitoring, and consulting PN modernization projects. BACKGROUND: The fast-paced technological advancement along with the associated threat is inevitable. The prevalence of smart phones, tablets, laptops, and IOT devices threatens the security of an organization and privacy of a person. People, through these mobile devices, are connected everywhere. Information is shared instantly with just a click of a fingertip. Classified information, such as mission, strategies, concepts of operations, technological specifications, and capability acquisition, is potentially at risk of getting exposed in the public; hence, security and protection of this information is very important. The social media, video sharing, and blogs are widely used technological tool for information dissemination; however, some information were posted without the consent of the PN. Unauthorized disclosure of classified documents containing details and plans of PN modernization projects poses threat to the conduct o",

NIST Special Publication 800-44 revision 2, Title: Guidelines on Securing Public Web Servers. PURPOSE: This circular provides guidelines and procedures on the development, administration, utilization, sustainment, and security of Philippine Navy websites and public-facing web servers. SCOPE: The provisions of this circular covers PN personnel who are directly or indirectly involved in the management and security of the PN Websites and public facing web servers. DEFINITION OF TERMS: Administrator - the super user or root that has a special user account used for maintaining and operating a computer system. Audit Trail or Audit Log - is a chronological sequence of audit records, each of which contains evidence directing pertaining to and resulting from the execution of a business process or system function. Content Management System (CMS) - is an application software developed for facilitating the maintenance of the content and not the design of a web· site. A \"blogging tool\" is an example of a Content Management System. cPANEL - a popular web-based administration tool used by the host providers, the PN in this particular case, to allow users (PN units) to configure their own websites using an easy-to-use interface. Domain name – is an address in the internet where the website can be accessed. It is used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses or lengthy numbers. Filip Transfer Protocol (FTP) - is rather predictably, a client-server protocol for transferring files. It is one way to download files, and the most common way to upload files to a server. An FTP client is a program which can download files from, or upload files to, an FTP server. Interact",

Project description, project structure, and the capabilities and limitations are briefly discussed to elucidate the finished project. The result of the evaluation and its interpretation was also presented in this chapter. Project Description The Cryptographic IM (CIM) system is an instant messaging application that allows data communication among peers. It provides essential features for office collaboration such as one-to-one chat, group chat, file transfer, and others. Multi-layered encryption is integrated into the CIM to provide greater security. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm encrypts the data as it traverses across the network. The system was developed in modules or components making it agile in any type of deployment. Meaning, the CIM can be deployed even without the other modules if it is not required for a particular deployment. There are three (3) modules developed, the base, file transfer, and the encryption module. The base component provides the platform for the two (2) components and other future components to be integrated into. These future components can also be a third-party DLL, API, or SDK. Project Structure The CIM was developed using the Microsoft Visual C# 2017. It runs on both MS Windows 7 and Windows 10 platform and requires dot.Net 4.6 framework. Microsoft Access database engine was included during the installation to allow local storage of user lists and other settings. The figure below shows the final structure of the system.

Interface Diagram of CIM Operational Concept and Dataflow Figure 2 from the previous page illustrates the fundamental structure of the system and flow of data from an end-user's perspective. Client X initiates a chat conversation with Client Y using the CIM client software. During the chat conversation, the system automatically encrypts the text message prior sending it to the IM Relay Server. The server now searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server transmits the encrypted text message to Client Y (recipient) through its socket. The server manages all clients' sockets. It handles authentication of all incoming clients prior acceptance of the socket. IM Relay Server maintains a minimal database using MS SQL Server, SQL Express, or MS Access for accounts and activity logs. As soon as the text message arrived at Client Y (recipient), the software then decrypts the text using the system-generated key as the default. Unreadable message or randomized characters indicates unmatched passkey. Both Client X (sender) and Client Y (recipient) m",

It explores the earlier developments, previous research, and existing technologies leading to the development of a prototype cryptographic IM (CIM). It includes the operational definition of terms used, and the conceptual framework to visually synthesize all materials and techniques in achieving the desired objective. Review of Related Literature and Studies Historical Development of Instant Messaging (IM) The advent of Instant Messenger like Facebook Messenger, Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other popular IM revolutionizes the way people communicate with each other. But its impressive features would not be possible without the earlier breakthrough of their predecessors. Desjardin (2016), in his article \"The Evolution of Instant Messaging\", narrates the written accounts that brought the IM and how it grows prominence in the new era. Instant Messaging became known in the 1990's but decades ago Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) already demonstrated an information sharing program called Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). In 1988, Jarkko Oikarinen developed the first chat system that allows sending messages to users through their computers (Oikarinen, 1988). His Internet Relay Chat (IRC) paved the way for other IM players like AOL IM, ICQ, and Microsoft IRC to battle for share in the IM market. Yahoo messenger dominates in 1998 with its intuitive designs and feature-rich IM environment. Engel (2014) recounts how IM grow prominence in the 2000s. This was the golden age of instant messenger. MSN Messenger introduced the concept of sharing photos and included the PC-to-PC and PC-to-phone audio capabilities. Skype Messenger peaked in popularity in 2003 as it showcased Audio and Video chat capabilities. Facebook chat was first introduced in 2008 and accelerated its popularity in 2014 when it decouples from the Facebo",
