To keep one's business on course this plan must be geared toward the business's mission—its product and service lines, its markets, its financial situation and marketing/sales tactics. The business must be aware of its strengths and weaknesses through internal and external analysis and look for market opportunities. The business must analyze its products and services from the viewpoint of the customer—outside-in thinking. What is the customer looking for and what does the customer want (benefits)? The business must gain knowledge of the marketplace from its customers. The business must analyze its target markets. What other additional markets can the business tap into and are there additional products or services the business can add? The business must know its competition, current and potential. By identifying the competitor's strengths and weaknesses the business can improve its position in the marketplace. The business must make decisions on how to apply its resources to the target market(s). The business must utilize the information it has gathered about itself, its customers, its markets, and its competition by developing a written Marketing Plan that provides measurable goals. The business must select marketing/sales tactics that will allow it to achieve or surpass its goals. The business must implement the plan (within an established budget) and then measure its success in terms of whether or not the goals were met (or the extent to which they were). The Marketing Plan is an ongoing tool designed to help the business compete in the market for customers. It should be re-visited, re-worked, and re-created often. 2 MARKETING PLAN OUTLINE There is no single \"right\" way to approach a marketing plan. Your marketing plan should be part of an ongoing self-evaluation process and unique to your business. A. Mission Statement 1. State the purpose of the marketing plan. 2.

Based on the answers to each question, the dashboard worksheet will automatically populate with the overall maturity level scores for the organization as a whole.

Setting up Eclipse: Java's popular IDE Summary This tutorial will help you to install JDK (Java Development Kit), setup Eclipse IDE (Integrated development environment) and get started with Java. Keywords: IDE, Eclipse, JDK Downloads First of all you have to download some stuff from the Internet: 1. Download the latest JDK from: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp 2. Download Eclipse IDE for Java Developers from: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ Installation Run JDK installer and follow instructions. After you installed the JDK, unpack eclipse archive somewhere on a disk and run eclipse.exe. Get started with Eclipse Select a workspace If you did previous steps right, you should see the following: You are asked to select a workspace directory, where all of your further projects would be stored. You may leave the default folder or choose another one. It's important to remember this path for future. After you choose the workspace location, press ok and wait a little, while Eclipse is loading. Creating a project Choose File New Java Project from menu. In the \"New Java Project\" window type \"HelloWorld\" in the project name edit box. Then press Finish button. Click with the right button on the HelloWorld project in package explorer. Choose New Class: Name it \"HelloWorld\" and set checker box to create main method stub. Then press Finish button. Type: System.out.println(\"Hello World!

Project description, project structure, and the capabilities and limitations are briefly discussed to elucidate the finished project. The result of the evaluation and its interpretation was also presented in this chapter. Project Description The Cryptographic IM (CIM) system is an instant messaging application that allows data communication among peers. It provides essential features for office collaboration such as one-to-one chat, group chat, file transfer, and others. Multi-layered encryption is integrated into the CIM to provide greater security. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm encrypts the data as it traverses across the network. The system was developed in modules or components making it agile in any type of deployment. Meaning, the CIM can be deployed even without the other modules if it is not required for a particular deployment. There are three (3) modules developed, the base, file transfer, and the encryption module. The base component provides the platform for the two (2) components and other future components to be integrated into. These future components can also be a third-party DLL, API, or SDK. 1592227317969 48 Project Structure The CIM was developed using the Microsoft Visual C# 2017. It runs on both MS Windows 7 and Windows 10 platform and requires dot.Net 4.6 framework. Microsoft Access database engine was included during the installation to allow local storage of user lists and other settings. The figure below shows the final structure of the system. Figure 10. Final Structure of the CIM The CIM is composed of Three (3) modules or components, namely: 1. Base Component – This is the most important component of the CIM. It provides the platform in which other components are integrated into. It comprised the forms, references, properties, libraries, and the main program needed to run the system. The following are the forms created for the base component: a. Login Form – it provides the interface needed to authenticate the user to the CIM server. The password entered by the user is automatically encrypted upon clicking the login button. Components/Modules/Classes CIM Base Component Forms File Transfer Module Encryption Module Chat Form Login Form File Transfer Form Group Chat Form 49 Figure 11. Login Form of the CIM b. Main Window Form – this is the main window that displays after a successful login. Groups and users are populated in the tree view. The green user icon indicates an online user while the gray icon indicates an offline user. Figure 12. Main Window of the CIM after a Successful Login c. Chat Form – this form allows the user to interact with other peers in the CIM through chat or text-based conversation. The chat communication is encrypted by default using AES 256-bit encryption with passkey 50 generated by the system. The user has the option to manually assign a key for a more private conversation. All system generated keys are changed weekly and stored on the server. This allows the organization to decode the previous conversation during an internal investigation as the need arises. Having keys manually entered denies the possibility of having someone to decode the conversation other than the two (2) communicating peers. Figure 13. One-to-One Chat d. Group Chat Form – this allows users to broadcast text conversation among members in the room. Like any similar room chat, any users can join the room and the moderator has the privilege to kick any members he or she chooses. Similar encryption is applied in this window. 51 Figure 14. Group Chat Form e. File Transfer Form – this form requires File Transfer module/class to function. It allows transmission of documents, images, audio, video, applications, and other files from one user to another. When applying encryption to the file, encryption module/class is called. The user has the option to use the HIPS for multi-layered encryption of the file. Figure 15. File Transfer Form 52 2. Encryption Component/ Module – this is the component that provides AES encryption and HIPS hiding feature to the CIM. This module can be deployed separately through Dynamic Link Library (DLL) and can be integrated to any applications. The figure below shows the resulting files after encrypted with AES and embedded in an image file (.cim file extension). Figure 16. CIM Automatic Encryption and Decryption a. AES Encryption – AES as explained in chapter two is an open standard algorithm which can be freely acquired and integrated into an application for strong and robust encryption. The CIM imports the AES library provided in the Microsoft .NET API and wrote specific functions applicable to the system. These four (4) functions are Encrypt String, Decrypt String, Encrypt File, and Decrypt File. The figure on the next page shows the class library for encryption. 53 Figure 17.

Client X initiates a chat conversation with Client Y using the CIM client software. During the chat conversation, the system automatically encrypts the text message prior sending it to the IM Relay Server. The server now searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server transmits the encrypted text message to Client Y (recipient) through its socket. The server manages all clients' sockets. It handles authentication of all incoming clients prior acceptance of the socket. IM Relay Server maintains a minimal database using MS SQL Server, SQL Express, or MS Access for accounts and activity logs. As soon as the text message arrived at Client Y (recipient), the software then decrypts the text using the system-generated key as the default. Unreadable message or randomized characters indicates unmatched passkey. Both Client X (sender) and Client Y (recipient) must encode manually the correct or agreed passkey to decode their conversation. The manual encoding of a passkey is done to deny the system administrator or any authority from decoding the message during the conduct of any special investigation. System generated keys are stored in the server specifically for this purpose. It is strongly suggested that this manual key should be transmitted through another mode of transmission like SMS, Email, or voice call. A similar procedure can be done during sending and receiving files. Client X starts up the File Transfer window and browse for the file. By default, CIM uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit to encrypt and decrypt text messages and files. The sender can choose to double encrypt the file by hiding it in an image file using 29 steganography or Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm. A checkbox or option button is provided for this feature. By checking both AES and HIPS, the system first encrypts the file using AES and hides the resulting file into an image. The CIM then transmits the image file to the IM relay server. The server searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server relays the file or message to Client Y (recipient). As soon as the encrypted file or image file arrived, the user can now browse for the file and choose to open it with the same application. The encrypted file is extracted from the image file using the HIPS function for file extraction. After the successful extraction, the CIM now tries to decrypt the extracted file using the system-generated key. If unsuccessful, it asks for the passkey which must be encoded by the receiving user to convert the encrypted file back to its original form. Manual encoding of passkey happens when the sender chooses to encode a different key other than the default system-generated key. Network Architecture To visualize its deployment from a technical perspective, the network diagram is drawn for this purpose. In figure 3 of the next page, the CIM primarily utilizes the Local Area Network (LAN) for inter-office instant messaging and collabor","routeslip":"","__v":0}

It explores the earlier developments, previous research, and existing technologies leading to the development of a prototype cryptographic IM (CIM). It includes the operational definition of terms used, and the conceptual framework to visually synthesize all materials and techniques in achieving the desired objective. Review of Related Literature and Studies Historical Development of Instant Messaging (IM) The advent of Instant Messenger like Facebook Messenger, Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other popular IM revolutionizes the way people communicate with each other. But its impressive features would not be possible without the earlier breakthrough of their predecessors. Desjardin (2016), in his article \"The Evolution of Instant Messaging\", narrates the written accounts that brought the IM and how it grows prominence in the new era. Instant Messaging became known in the 1990's but decades ago Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) already demonstrated an information sharing program called Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). In 1988, Jarkko Oikarinen developed the first chat system that allows sending messages to users through their computers (Oikarinen, 1988). His Internet Relay Chat (IRC) paved the way for other IM players like AOL IM, ICQ, and Microsoft IRC to battle for share in the IM market. Yahoo messenger 1595148339648 7 dominates in 1998 with its intuitive designs and feature-rich IM environment. Engel (2014) recounts how IM grow prominence in the 2000s. This was the golden age of instant messenger. MSN Messenger introduced the concept of sharing photos and included the PC-to-PC and PC-to-phone audio capabilities. Skype Messenger peaked in popularity in 2003 as it showcased Audio and Video chat capabilities. Facebook chat was first introduced in 2008 and accelerated its popularity in 2014 when it decouples from the Facebook App. Application of IM Military Institution The US military has long been using IM for its military operations. In fact, Cummings (2005, p. 654) stated: \"It was the primary means of communication between navy ships during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003\". In his journal \"The Need for Command and Control Instant Message Adaptive Interfaces: Lessons Learned from Tactical Tomahawk Human-in-the-Loop Simulations\" Cummings affirms the obvious advantage in real-time communication embodied in IM. It allows rapid response to inquiries, multiple conversations with various units, and access to previous conversations and orders. In a thesis presentation entitled \"Applicability of Instant Messaging in the Military Command and Control Systems\"; Vermaja (n.d.) explains that IM can offer many advantages but security issues in implementing it is a problem. Furthermore, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) IM does not satisfy wholly the needs of a Command and Control (C2) communication. Customized applications are needed to make the 8 communication easy and practical. Tailor-fit applications with specific platforms are needed in order to build automated systems. Businesses Various studies were already conducted on the maturity of IM to be used for business communication. Results clarify how businessmen and their clients choose this technology for daily transactions and communication. It was learned that people, generally, uses IM for a variety of substantive business purposes, and their peers include a diversity of co-workers, clients, managers, and other business personalities (Muller, Raven, Kogan, Millen, & Carey, 2003). Gotrunk (2017), a US company that offers secure and reliable VOIP services, shares their experience in IM. According to them, businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their office communication. IM is virtually real-time communication like a telephone call. It is a text-based conversation like email but in an instant. It proves advantageous for collaboration among employees from different locations. In fact, some employees even use it for private communication within and outside the office. Schools People of college age constitute a significant and considerable number or population among IM users. Flanagin (2005), in his study, found out that IM has become a central communication tool within the college population. IM is being used for a variety of personal needs and school requirements and utilized it heavily relative to other forms of communication like email and telephone. Moreover, evidence suggests that college students are satisfied with simultaneously processing multiple conversations and that IM might displace email in many consequential ways. 9 Security Issues of IM The efficiency and usability of this application come with a major drawback on security. Hackers and cybersecurity professionals found several vulnerabilities with this system. These problems make most organizations to re-think implementing and adapting IM. ","routeslip":"","__v":0}

Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user- friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their office communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making. In 1591951189703 2 today's network-centric operation, Instant Messaging (IM) is an essential information communication tool for rapid delivery of messages and reports, and for situational awareness. The US military has long been using IM for its military operations. In fact, Cummings (2004, p. 654) stated that \"it was the primary means of communication between navy ships during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003\". The Philippine Navy (PN), a branch of service in the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), sought to acquire similar tool but is constrained with limited resources and lack of communication infrastructure to securely extend its network to mobile units thereby utilizing the un- secure Internet for its data communication. The PN, with its prevailing need for a secure data communication like an instant messaging, started to adopt several free and open-source IM but unsatisfied with the minimal encryption it provides. Text messages can be intercepted, decoded, and read in clear text as it travels across the network from sender to receiver. The pervasiveness of these applications makes it vulnerable from various attacks especially sniffing and hijacking. Some vendors, however, promise end-to-end or asynchronous encryption with their expensive commercial IM. They may either use open-standard advanced encryption protocols or they are using closed and proprietary protocols. The benefit it provides may surpass that of the free versions, however, the vendor obscures any vulnerabilities of this application from the end-users and it will not be long until a sophisticated hacker can crack its encryption protocol through a purchase of similar application. Among the popular IMs available online are unencrypted by default such as Facebook Messenger, Pidgin, Google Allo, and Viber. IMs are designed with usability 3 rather than security in mind. Almost all freeware IM software does not have encryption capabilities. Few news articles can be found as an evidence of this vulnerability, many IM vendors bargain this flaw as leverage for the users to purchase the licensed version. Eavesdropping and sniffing IM conversation is common to most hackers and cybersecurity professionals especially if they are within the Local Area Network (LAN). Data security is of utmost importance in any organization whether private or government sector. The effect of confidential messages being sniffed, leaked, or compromised can be devastating to any individuals, businesses or institutions such as the Armed Forces. Quality of software should be measured not just by the functionality and performance but also the security it guarantees. It has to assure the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and availability of the data it processes. Thus, adoption of an encryption mechanism is imperative to secure the data at-rest or in-transit. The growing importance of security for an IM or for any type of application cannot be overemphasized. All communication application (i.e Instant Messenger) must be integrated with an encryption algorithm that is proven unbreakable and resistant to any mathematical cracking techniques. With an encryption component present in an IM, users are assured of an optimum level of security the software provides. Data hiding or Steganography has been used to hide secret messages into an image. While it is commonly used as a standalone application, it has never been implemented into an IM.

Circular nr 29 dated 06 December 2017, Subject: PN Cybersecurity Policy. d. 20 Critical Security Controls by SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security (SANS) Institute. 2. PURPOSE: The purpose of this policy is to establish a standard for the administration of user accounts that facilitate access PN information systems. An account, at minimum, consists of a user ID and a password; supplying account information will usually grant access to some set of services and resources. This policy establishes standards for issuing accounts, creating password values, and managing accounts. a) SCOPE: This SOP is applicable to units 6's and CEIS units for the management of user accounts or access to shared information or network devices. b) DEFINITION OF TERMS: a. Asset - is any data, device, or other component of the environment that supports information-related activities. Assets generally include hardware (e.g. servers and switches), software (e.g. mission critical applications and support systems) and confidential information. b. Cybersecurity -deliberate synergy of technologies, processes, and practices to protect information and the networks, computer systems and appliances, and programs used to collect, process, store, and transport that information from attack, damage and unauthorized access. c. Cybersecurity Posture – refers to the overall cybersecurity strength of an PN. It expresses the relative security of the IT estate and its vulnerability to outside threats. d. Risk Assessment – is a process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks of PNal assets and operations. It involves evaluating hazards, and developing plans to remove or minimize the level of risk. e. Security Controls - refers to technical, physical, and administrative safeguards to detect cyber threats, minimize risks, and protect from cyber attacks. c) POLICIES: a. Account Administration Accounts that access electronic computing and information resources require prudent oversight. The following security precautions should be part of account management: 1) Issuance of Accounts a) The PN shall issue a unique account to each individual authorized to access that networked computing and information resource. b) When establishing accounts, standard security principles of \"least required access\" to perform a function must always be used, where administratively feasible. For example, a root or administrative privileged account must not be used when a non-privileged account will do. c) Passwords for new accounts should NOT be emailed to remote users UNLESS the email is encrypted. d) The date when the account was issued should be recorded in an audit log or captured electronically. 2) Management of Accounts a) All accounts shall be reviewed at least annually to ensure that access and account privileges are commensurate with job function, need-to- know, and employment status. b) All guest accounts with access to PN network shall contain an expiration date of one year or the work completion date, whichever occurs first. c) Require multi-factor authentication for all user accounts, on all systems, whether managed onsite or by a third-party provider. 3) Account Monitoring a) Maintain an inventory of each of the PN's authentication systems, including those located onsite or at a remote service provider. b) Maintain an inventory of all accounts organized by authentication system. d) Ensure that all accounts have an expiration date that is monitored and enforced. e) Configure access for all accounts through as few centralized points of authentication as possible, including network, security, and cloud systems. c) Establish and follow an automated process for revoking system access by disabling accounts immediately upon termination or change of responsibilities PN personnel. Disabling these accounts, instead of deleting accounts, allows preservation of audit trails. d) Automatically disable dormant accounts after a set period of inactivity. e) Monitor attempts to access deactivated accounts through audit logging. f) Alert when users deviate from normal login behavior, such as time-of-day, workstation location and duration. g) Automatically lock workstation sessions after a standard period of inactivity 4) Administration of Password a) The identity of users must be authenticated before providing them with ID and password details. In addition, it is required that stricter levels of authentication (such as face-to-face) be used for those accounts with privileged access. b) Whenever possible, passkeys should be used to authenticate a user when resetting a password or activating a guest account, and should comply with the abo","routeslip":"","__v":0}

Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Devices Reduce the ability of attackers to find and exploit unauthorized and unprotected systems: Use active monitoring and configuration management to maintain an up-to-date inventory of devices connected to the enterprise network, including servers, workstations, laptops, and remote devices. No inventory of authorized and unauthorized devices Program for Asset Management System such as MS Active Directory 2. Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software Identify vulnerable or malicious software to mitigate or root out attacks: Devise a list of authorized software for each type of system, and deploy tools to track software installed (including type, version, and patches) and monitor for unauthorized or unnecessary software. 3. Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices, Laptop, Workstations, and Servers Prevent attackers from exploiting services and settings that allow easy access through networks and browsers: Build a secure image that is used for all new systems deployed to the enterprises, host these standard images on secure storage servers, regularly validate and update these configurations, and track system images in a configuration management system. 4. Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation Proactively identify and repair software vulnerabilities reported by security researchers or vendors: Regularly run automated vulnerability scanning tools against all systems and quickly remediate any vulnerabilities, which critical problems fixed within 48 hours. 5. Malware Defenses Block malicious code from tampering with system settings or contents, capturing sensitive data, or spreading: Use automated anti-virus and anti- 1588087378022 spyware to continuously monitor and protect workstations, servers, and mobile devices. Automatically update such anti-malware tools on all machines on a daily basis. Prevent network devices from using auto-run programs to access removable media. 6. Application Software Security Neutralize vulnerabilities in web-based and other applications software: Carefully test internally developed and third-party application software for security flaws, including coding errors and malware. Deploy web application firewalls that inspect all traffic, and explicitly check for errors in all users input (including by size and data type). 7. Wireless Device Control Protect the security perimeter against unauthorized wireless access. Allow wireless devices to connect to the network only if they match an authorized configuration and security profile and have a documented owner and defined business need. Ensure that all wireless access points are manageable using enterprise management tools. Configure scanning tools to detect wireless access points. 8. Data Recovery Capability Minimize the damage from an attack: Implement a trustworthy plan for removing all traces an attack. Automatically back up all information required to fully restore each system, including the operating system, application software, and data. Back up all systems at least weekly; back up sensitive systems more often. Regularly test the restoration process. 9. Security Skills Assessment and Appropriate Training to Fill Gaps Find knowledge gaps, and fill them with exercises and training: Develop security skills assessment program, map training against the skills required for each job, and use the results to allocate resources effectively to improve security practices. 10. Secure Configurations for Network Devices such as Firewalls, Router, and Switches Preclude electronic holes from forming at connection points with the Internet, other organizations, and internal networks segments: Compare firewall, router, and switch configurations against standards for each type of networks device. Ensure that any deviations from the standard configurations are documented and approved and that any temporary deviations are undone when the business need abates. 11. Limited and Control of Networks Ports, Protocols, and Services Allow remote access only to legitimate users and services: Apply host- based firewalls and port-filtering and scanning tools to block traffic that is not explicitly allowed. Properly configure web servers, mail servers, file and print services, and domain name system (DNS) servers to limit remote access. Disable automatic installation of unnecessary software components. Move servers inside the firewall unless remote access is required for business purposes. 12. Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges Protect and validate administrative accounts on desktops, laptops, and servers to prevent two common types of attack (1) enticing users to open a malicious e-mail, attachment, or file, or to visit a malicious website; and (2) cracking an administrative password and thereby gaining access to","routeslip":"","__v":0}

May we take this opportunity to summarize the Globodox DMS objectives discussed during the meeting: 1. To respond quickly to the search/retrieval of records. Globodox DMS provides several search methods including the retrieval of records by indices or by a document's content, very similar to how a search and retrieve is made in Yahoo or Google. 2. To demonstrate office efficiency. Retrieval of records can be by school name, by teacher's name such as last name, first name, middle name, locality, and other fields. FMWC would like to define. Globodox DMS provides simple and advance search functions. 3. To have a backup of records electronically. Electronic records (scanned civil registry images, Microsoft Office files, email, and other forms of electronic files) placed into Globodox DMS can be copied into external medias to serve as a backup of original paper and office records. 4. To maintain disaster recovery measures in times of fire, rain, and earthquakes. In case of disaster, Globodox DMS can utilize these external disks/CDs and recreate the server database for business continuity. Floro International Corporation Unit 717B, ACG Buding Shaw Boulevard, Wack Wack, Mandaluyong Phone 533-2584 Fax: 654-7215 email: floro@floro-intl.com www.floro-intl.com, www.digitizingdocuments.com 2000-001 5. To relieve employees from clerical activities such as searching, retrieving and printing. 6. To provide security of original documents. Paper documents do not need to be accessed, thereby minimizing loss or misfiled documents though the use of Globodox DMS. Moreover, minimizing the handling of paper documents minimizes the wear and tear caused by handling. 7. To provide transfer of technology to the employees of FMWC through training and implementation of the Globodox DMS system. We have also enclosed our proposal for your request of 10 full license and 9 viewing license for the Globodox Standard version. Please feel free to let us know of areas that need further clarification. Sincerely, Patricia Ann Floro Vice President, Business Systems Floro International Corporation I.

North Korea's state-sponsored hacking crews are breaking into online stores to insert malicious code that can steal buyers' payment card details as they visit the checkout page and fill in payment forms. Attacks on online stores have been going on since May 2019, said Dutch cyber-security firm SanSec in a report published today. These types of attacks are named \"web skimming,\" \"e—skimming,\" or \"Magecart attack,\" with the last name coming from the name of the first group who engaged in such tactics. Web skimming attacks are simple in nature, although they require advanced technical skills from hackers to execute. The goal is for hackers to gain access to a web store's backend server, associated resources, or third-party widgets, where they can install and run malicious code on the store's frontend. The code loads only on the check out page, and silently logs payment card details as they're entered into checkout forms. This data is then exfiltrated to a remote server, from where hackers collect it and sell it on underground cybercrime markets. ","routeslip":"","__v":0}

This is caused by Windows holding a lock on the files for longer than normal, which is behavior associated with the Details view and Preview Pane layout. Per Microsoft Support, the cause of this issue is a sharing violation that happens between the operating system and the Office application over a network resource. WORKAROUNDS On desktops accessing the files on a remote shared folder, modify the following settings to disable the Windows functions that cause this behavior: Windows Explorer: 1. Click one of the following: Tools > Folder Options > View or Organize >Folder and search op ons. o Clear Show pop-up description for folder and desktop items. o Clear Show preview handlers in preview pane. 2. Click Organize -> Layout. o Clear Details Pane. o Clear Preview Pane. In Office 2010: 1. Go to File > Options > Trust center > Trust Center settings. 2. Clear Protected View. 3. Click OK. In Office 2010/2013: 1. Go to File > Options > Trust center > Trust Center settings > Trusted Locations. 2. Place a check next to Allow Trusted Locations on my network as shown below. 3. Click OK.

It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user- friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-Way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their ofďŹce communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making.

Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten—gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risque and the balloon was left blank. According to Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg, \"at this point, David's intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's Metropolis: the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man who Sold the world.\"[4] Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance.[4] The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish.[17] It has been said that his \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo, were inspired by a Pre- Raphaelite painting by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.[18] In the United States, Mercury rejected MacMillan's photo and released the album with weller's design as its cover, much to the displeasure of Bowie, although he successfully lobbied the label to use the photo for the record's release in the United Kingdom. In 1972, he said weller's design was \"horrible\" but reappraised it in 1999, saying he \"actually thought the cartoon cover was really cool\".[4] while promoting The Man who Sold the world in the US, Bowie wore the Mr Fish dress in February 1971 on his first promotional tour and during interviews, despite the fact that the Americans had no knowledge of the as yet unreleased UK cover.[17] The 1971 German release presented a winged hybrid creature with Bowie's head and a hand for a body, preparing to flick the Earth away. The 1972 worldwide reissue by RCA Records used a black—and—white picture of Ziggy Stardust on the sleeve. This image remained the cover art on reissues until 1990, when the Rykodisc release reinstated the UK \"dress\" cover. The \"dress\" cover has appeared on subsequent reissues of the album.[19] fox Page move—protected Stormtrooper (Star wars) From wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigationJump to search \"Imperial Stormtroopers\" redirects here.

For each scenario, the teams will submit a report of their accomplishments which will be evaluated and verified by the Attack Task Group (ATG) to determine the total points acquired by each team. Verification is performed in combination of automated and manual review of the reports and evidences presented. For automated evaluation by a computer program or script, the teams will be provided with a formatted template with clear specifications that must be strictly followed. No considerations are given for wrong specification of data that may be unreadable. Each scenario has unique set of objectives and, therefore, teams will have different ways of earning points. Scenario 1 - Capture the Flag Objective: Red teams compete to gather as many flags as possible from the various challenges given. Result: DICT wins with 1600 point followed by PAF with 1500 and CEISSAFP with 1300 points. Scenario 2 - Network Discovery Objective: Discover the network and come up with a network map. Each team will identify the hosts, its running services, network devices, and determine how they are connected to each other in the network. A reporting template is distributed for each team to fill-in with the required information. Result: The RESERVIST identified the most number of devices and came up with accurate map of the network.

For each scenario, the teams will submit a report of their accomplishments which will be evaluated and verified by the Attack Task Group (ATG) to determine the total points acquired by each team. Verification is performed in combination of automated and manual review of the reports and evidences presented. For automated evaluation by a computer program or script, the teams will be provided with a formatted template with clear specifications that must be strictly followed. No considerations are given for wrong specification of data that may be unreadable. Each scenario has unique set of objectives and, therefore, teams will have different ways of earning points. Scenario 1 - Capture the Flag Objective: Red teams compete to gather as many flags as possible from the various challenges given. Result: DICT wins with 1600 point followed by PAF with 1500 and CEISSAFP with 1300 points. Scenario 2 - Network Discovery Objective: Discover the network and come up with a network map. Each team will identify the hosts, its running services, network devices, and determine how they are connected to each other in the network. A reporting template is distributed for each team to fill-in with the required information. Result: The RESERVIST identified the most number of devices and came up with accurate map of the network.

Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten—gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risque and the balloon was left blank. According to Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg, \"at this point, David's intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's Metropolis: the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man who Sold the world.\"[4] Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance.[4] The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish.[17] It has been said that his \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo, were inspired by a Pre- Raphaelite painting by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.[18] In the United States, Mercury rejected MacMillan's photo and released the album with weller's design as its cover, much to the displeasure of Bowie, although he successfully lobbied the label to use the photo for the record's release in the United Kingdom. In 1972, he said weller's design was \"horrible\" but reappraised it in 1999, saying he \"actually thought the cartoon cover was really cool\".[4] while promoting The Man who Sold the world in the US, Bowie wore the Mr Fish dress in February 1971 on his first promotional tour and during interviews, despite the fact that the Americans had no knowledge of the as yet unreleased UK cover.[17] The 1971 German release presented a winged hybrid creature with Bowie's head and a hand for a body, preparing to flick the Earth away. The 1972 worldwide reissue by RCA Records used a black—and—white picture of Ziggy Stardust on the sleeve. This image remained the cover art on reissues until 1990, when the Rykodisc release reinstated the UK \"dress\" cover. The \"dress\" cover has appeared on subsequent reissues of the album.[19] fox Page move—protected Stormtrooper (Star wars) From wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigationJump to search \"Imperial Stormtroopers\" redirects here.

This is caused by Windows holding a lock on the files for longer than normal, which is behavior associated with the Details view and Preview Pane layout. Per Microsoft Support, the cause of this issue is a sharing violation that happens between the operating system and the Office application over a network resource. WORKAROUNDS On desktops accessing the files on a remote shared folder, modify the following settings to disable the Windows functions that cause this behavior: Windows Explorer: 1.

Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten—gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risque and the balloon was left blank. According to Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg, \"at this point, David's intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's Metropolis: the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man who Sold the world.\"[4] Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance.[4] The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish.[17] It has been said that his \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo, were inspired by a Pre- Raphaelite painting by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.[18] In the United States, Mercury rejected MacMillan's photo and released the album with weller's design as its cover, much to the displeasure of Bowie, although he successfully lobbied the label to use the photo for the record's release in the United Kingdom. In 1972, he said weller's design was \"horrible\" but reappraised it in 1999, saying he \"actually thought the cartoon cover was really cool\".[4] while promoting The Man who Sold the world in the US, Bowie wore the Mr Fish dress in February 1971 on his first promotional tour and during interviews, despite the fact that the Americans had no knowledge of the as yet unreleased UK cover.[17] The 1971 German release presented a winged hybrid creature with Bowie's head and a hand for a body, preparing to flick the Earth away.

It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user- friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-Way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their ofďŹce communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making.

Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten—gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\".

In order to use this tool, the assessor must only complete the answers to the drop down menu questions lists on the pages labeled CSC #1 - CSC #20.

Based on the answers to each question, the dashboard worksheet will automatically populate with the overall maturity level scores for the organization as a whole.

Any questions about how this tool works or suggestions can be directed to info@auditscripts.com. In order to use this tool, the assessor must only complete the answers to the drop down menu questions lists on the pages labeled CSC #1 - CSC #20. By choosing a drop down choice for each critical control, the assessment tool will automatically generate scores and maturity level based on the answers to each question. Based on the answers to each question, the dashboard worksheet will automatically populate with the overall maturity level scores for the organization as a whole. These scores can therefore be used to measure the organization's progress and what percentage of the Critical Security Controls they are currently following.

Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Devices Reduce the ability of attackers to find and exploit unauthorized and unprotected systems: Use active monitoring and configuration management to maintain an up-to-date inventory of devices connected to the enterprise network, including servers, workstations, laptops, and remote devices. No inventory of authorized and unauthorized devices Program for Asset Management System such as MS Active Directory 2. Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software Identify vulnerable or malicious software to mitigate or root out attacks: Devise a list of authorized software for each type of system, and deploy tools to track software installed (including type, version, and patches) and monitor for unauthorized or unnecessary software. 3. Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices, Laptop, Workstations, and Servers Prevent attackers from exploiting services and settings that allow easy access through networks and browsers: Build a secure image that is used for all new systems deployed to the enterprises, host these standard images on secure storage servers, regularly validate and update these configurations, and track system images in a configuration management system. 4. Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation Proactively identify and repair software vulnerabilities reported by security researchers or vendors: Regularly run automated vulnerability scanning tools against all systems and quickly remediate any vulnerabilities, which critical problems fixed within 48 hours. 5. Malware Defenses Block malicious code from tampering with system settings or contents, capturing sensitive data, or spreading: Use automated anti-virus and anti- 1588064653459 spyware to continuously monitor and protect workstations, servers, and mobile devices. Automatically update such anti-malware tools on all machines on a daily basis. Prevent network devices from using auto-run programs to access removable media. 6. Application Software Security Neutralize vulnerabilities in web-based and other applications software: Carefully test internally developed and third-party application software for security flaws, including coding errors and malware. Deploy web application firewalls that inspect all traffic, and explicitly check for errors in all users input (including by size and data type). 7. Wireless Device Control Protect the security perimeter against unauthorized wireless access. Allow wireless devices to connect to the network only if they match an authorized configuration and security profile and have a documented owner and defined business need. Ensure that all wireless access points are manageable using enterprise management tools. Configure scanning tools to detect wireless access points. 8. Data Recovery Capability Minimize the damage from an attack: Implement a trustworthy plan for removing all traces an attack. Automatically back up all information required to fully restore each system, including the operating system, application software, and data. Back up all systems at least weekly; back up sensitive systems more often. Regularly test the restoration process. 9. Security Skills Assessment and Appropriate Training to Fill Gaps Find knowledge gaps, and fill them with exercises and training: Develop security skills assessment program, map training against the skills required for each job, and use the results to allocate resources effectively to improve security practices. 10. Secure Configurations for Network Devices such as Firewalls, Router, and Switches Preclude electronic holes from forming at connection points with the Internet, other organizations, and internal networks segments: Compare firewall, router, and switch configurations against standards for each type of networks device. Ensure that any deviations from the standard configurations are documented and approved and that any temporary deviations are undone when the business need abates. 11. Limited and Control of Networks Ports, Protocols, and Services Allow remote access only to legitimate users and services: Apply host- based firewalls and port-filtering and scanning tools to block traffic that is not explicitly allowed. Properly configure web servers, mail servers, file and print services, and domain name system (DNS) servers to limit remote access. Disable automatic installation of unnecessary software components. Move servers inside the firewall unless remote access is required for business purposes. 12. Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges Protect and validate administrative accounts on desktops, laptops, and servers to prevent two common types of attack (1) enticing users to open a malicious e-mail, attachment, or file, or to visit a malicious website; and (2) cracking an administrative password and thereby gaining access to","routeslip":"","__v":0}

It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user- friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their office communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making. In 1590458179904 2 today's network-centric operation, Instant Messaging (IM) is an essential information communication tool for rapid delivery of messages and reports, and for situational awareness. The US military has long been using IM for its military operations. In fact, Cummings (2004, p. 654) stated that \"it was the primary means of communication between navy ships during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003\". The Philippine Navy (PN), a branch of service in the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), sought to acquire similar tool but is constrained with limited resources and lack of communication infrastructure to securely extend its network to mobile units thereby utilizing the un- secure Internet for its data communication. The PN, with its prevailing need for a secure data communication like an instant messaging, started to adopt several free and open-source IM but unsatisfied with the minimal encryption it provides. Text messages can be intercepted, decoded, and read in clear text as it travels across the network from sender to receiver. The pervasiveness of these applications makes it vulnerable from various attacks especially sniffing and hijacking. Some vendors, however, promise end-to-end or asynchronous encryption with their expensive commercial IM. They may either use open-standard advanced encryption protocols or they are using closed and proprietary protocols. The benefit it provides may surpass that of the free versions, however, the vendor obscures any vulnerabilities of this application from the end-users and it will not be long until a sophisticated hacker can crack its encryption protocol through a purchase of similar application. Among the popular IMs available online are unencrypted by default such as Facebook Messenger, Pidgin, Google Allo, and Viber. IMs are designed with usability 3 rather than security in mind. Almost all freeware IM software does not have encryption capabilities. Few news articles can be found as an evidence of this vulnerability, many IM vendors bargain this flaw as leverage for the users to purchase the licensed version. Eavesdropping and sniffing IM conversation is common to most hackers and cybersecurity professionals especially if they are within the Local Area Network (LAN). Data security is of utmost importance in any organization whether private or government sector. The effect of confidential messages being sniffed, leaked, or compromised can be devastating to any individuals, businesses or institutions such as the Armed Forces. Quality of software should be measured not just by the functionality and performance but also the security it guarantees. It has to assure the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and availability of the data it processes. Thus, adoption of an encryption mechanism is imperative to secure the data at-rest or in-transit. The growing importance of security for an IM or for any type of application cannot be overemphasized. All communication application (i.e Instant Messenger) must be integrated with an encryption algorithm that is proven unbreakable and resistant to any mathematical cracking techniques. With an encryption component present in an IM, users are assured of an optimum level of security the software provides. Data hiding or Steganography has been used to hide secret messages into an image. While it is commonly used as a standalone application, it has never been implemented into an IM.

Circular nr 29 dated 06 December 2017, Subject: PN Cybersecurity Policy. d. 20 Critical Security Controls by SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security (SANS) Institute. 2. PURPOSE: The purpose of this policy is to establish a standard for the administration of user accounts that facilitate access PN information systems. An account, at minimum, consists of a user ID and a password; supplying account information will usually grant access to some set of services and resources. This policy establishes standards for issuing accounts, creating password values, and managing accounts. a) SCOPE: This SOP is applicable to units 6's and CEIS units for the management of user accounts or access to shared information or network devices. b) DEFINITION OF TERMS: a. Asset - is any data, device, or other component of the environment that supports information-related activities. Assets generally include hardware (e.g. servers and switches), software (e.g. mission critical applications and support systems) and confidential information. b. Cybersecurity -deliberate synergy of technologies, processes, and practices to protect information and the networks, computer systems and appliances, and programs used to collect, process, store, and transport that information from attack, damage and unauthorized access. c. Cybersecurity Posture – refers to the overall cybersecurity strength of an PN. It expresses the relative security of the IT estate and its vulnerability to outside threats. d. Risk Assessment – is a process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks of PNal assets and operations. It involves evaluating hazards, and developing plans to remove or minimize the level of risk. e. Security Controls - refers to technical, physical, and administrative safeguards to detect cyber threats, minimize risks, and protect from cyber attacks. c) POLICIES: a. Account Administration Accounts that access electronic computing and information resources require prudent oversight. The following security precautions should be part of account management: 1) Issuance of Accounts a) The PN shall issue a unique account to each individual authorized to access that networked computing and information resource. b) When establishing accounts, standard security principles of \"least required access\" to perform a function must always be used, where administratively feasible. For example, a root or administrative privileged account must not be used when a non-privileged account will do. c) Passwords for new accounts should NOT be emailed to remote users UNLESS the email is encrypted. d) The date when the account was issued should be recorded in an audit log or captured electronically. 2) Management of Accounts a) All accounts shall be reviewed at least annually to ensure that access and account privileges are commensurate with job function, need-to- know, and employment status. b) All guest accounts with access to PN network shall contain an expiration date of one year or the work completion date, whichever occurs first. c) Require multi-factor authentication for all user accounts, on all systems, whether managed onsite or by a third-party provider. 3) Account Monitoring a) Maintain an inventory of each of the PN's authentication systems, including those located onsite or at a remote service provider. b) Maintain an inventory of all accounts organized by authentication system. d) Ensure that all accounts have an expiration date that is monitored and enforced. e) Configure access for all accounts through as few centralized points of authentication as possible, including network, security, and cloud systems. c) Establish and follow an automated process for revoking system access by disabling accounts immediately upon termination or change of responsibilities PN personnel.

This is caused by Windows holding a lock on the files for longer than normal, which is behavior associated with the Details view and Preview Pane layout. Per Microsoft Support, the cause of this issue is a sharing violation that happens between the operating system and the Office application over a network resource. WORKAROUNDS On desktops accessing the files on a remote shared folder, modify the following settings to disable the Windows functions that cause this behavior: Windows Explorer: 1. Click one of the following: Tools > Folder Options > View or Organize >Folder and search options. o Clear Show pop-up description for folder and desktop items. o Clear Show preview handlers in preview pane. 2. Click Organize -> Layout. o Clear Details Pane. o Clear Preview Pane. In Office 2010: 1. Go to File > Options > Trust center > Trust Center settings. 2. Clear Protected View. 3. Click OK. In Office 2010/2013: 1. Go to File > Options > Trust center > Trust Center settings > Trusted Locations. 2. Place a check next to Allow Trusted Locations on my network as shown below. 3. Click OK.

The activity displayed by LastActivityView includes: Running .exe file, Opening open/save dialog-box, Opening file/folder from Explorer or other software, software installation, system shutdown/start, application or system crash, network connection/disconnection and more... You can easily export this information into csv/tab-delimited/xml/html file or copy it to the clipboard and then paste into Excel or other software. System Requirements =================== This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000 and up to Windows 10. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported. Known Limitations ================= This tool gathers information from various sources, including the Registry, the events log of Windows, the Prefetch folder of Windows (C:\\windows\\Prefetch), the MiniDump folder of Windows (C:\\Windows\\Minidump), and more... The accuracy and the availability of the information displayed by LastActivityView might be different from one system to another. For example, if the user or a software makes changes in the Registry, the action time displayed by LastActivityView might be wrong, because it's based on the modified time of some Registry keys. Also, for every type of action/event, there is some limitation according to the way that the information is saved in the system. For example, the 'Select file in open/save dialog-box' action is limited for one action of every file extension, so if the user opened 2 .doc files with the open/save dialog-box, only the last one will be displayed. Versions History ================ * Version 1.32: o Fix bug: On Windows 10/8 - In some folder names of 'View Folder in Explorer' items, LastActivityView omitted the first 2 characters. * Version 1.31: o Added 'Task Run' action, which is displayed when a task was executed by the 'Task Scheduler' of Windows. (Works on Windows Vista or later) * Version 1.30: o Added 'Quick Filter' feature (View -> Use Quick Filter or Ctrl+Q). When it's turned on, you can type a string in the text-box added under the toolbar and LastActivityView will instantly filter the actions list, showing only lines that contain the string you typed. * Version 1.27: o You can now choose whether to read the archive log files (Options -> Read Archive Log Files) * Version 1.26: o Added 'Sleep' action. * Version 1.25: o LastActivityView now automatically reads archive log files (Archive-*.evtx) . * Version 1.20: o Added 'Wireless Network Connected' and 'Wireless Network Disconnected' actions (For Windows Vista and later). This information is collected from Microsoft-Windows-WLAN-AutoConfig/Operational event log. * Version 1.16: o For 'Run .EXE file' actions, the version information of the .exe file is now displayed in the 'More Information' column. * Version 1.15: o Added option to show only the activity in the last xx seconds/minutes/hours/days (In 'Advanced Options' window). * Version 1.12: o You can now choose the desired encoding (ANSI, UTF-8, UTF-16) to save the csv/xml/text/html files. (Under the Options menu) * Version 1.11: o LastActivityView now uses the 8 date/time values stored in the Prefetch files of Windows 8 and Windows 10 ('Run .EXE file' action). * Version 1.10: o Fixed LastActivityView to detect the 'Run .EXE file' action on Windows 10. * Version 1.09: o Explorer context menu inside LastActivityView: When you right-click on a single item with a file or folder while holding down the shift key, LastActivityView now displays the context menu of Windows Explorer, instead of the LastActivityView context menu. * Version 1.08: o Fixed bug: LastActivityView failed to remember the last size/position of the main window if it was not located in the primary monitor. * Version 1.07: o Added 'Copy Files List' option. o Added 'Open Folder In Explorer' option. o Fixed to find the correct item when typing the string you want to search into the main List View. * Version 1.06: o Fixed to show properly the folder path of 'View Folder In Explorer' action on Windows 8.1 . * Version 1.05: o Added 'File Extension' column. o Added secondary sorting support: You can now get a secondary sorting, by holding down the shift key while clicking the column header. Be aware that you only have to hold down the shift key when clicking the second/third/fourth column. To sort the first column you should not hold down the Shift key. * Version 1.04: o Fixed to display date/time properly according to daylight saving time settings. * Version 1.03: o Added secondary sorting: When clicking the 'Description' column header, the list is sorted by the Description, and then by the 'Action time' column. * Version 1.02: o User information is now display","routeslip":"","__v":0}

Weller, featuring a cowboy in front of the Cane Hill mental asylum.[16] Weller, whose friend was a patient there, suggested the idea after Bowie had asked him to create a design that would capture the music's foreboding tone. Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John Wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten-gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risqué and the balloon was left blank. According to Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg, \"at this point, David's intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's Metropolis: the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man Who Sold the World.\"[4] Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance.[4] The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish.[17] It has been said that his \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo, were inspired by a Pre-Raphaelite painting by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.[18] In the United States, Mercury rejected MacMillan's photo and released the album with Weller's design as its cover, much to the displeasure of Bowie, although he successfully lobbied the label to use the photo for the record's release in the United Kingdom. In 1972, he said Weller's design was \"horrible\" but reappraised it in 1999, saying he \"actually thought the cartoon cover was really cool\".[4] While promoting The Man Who Sold the World in the US, Bowie wore the Mr Fish dress in February 1971 on his first promotional tour and during interviews, despite the fact that the Americans had no knowledge of the as yet unreleased UK cover.[17] The 1971 German release presented a winged hybrid creature with Bowie's head and a hand for a body, preparing to flick the Earth away. The 1972 worldwide reissue by RCA Records used a black-and-white picture of Ziggy Stardust on the sleeve. This image remained the cover art on reissues until 1990, when the Rykodisc release reinstated the UK \"dress\" cover. The \"dress\" cover has appeared on subsequent reissues of the album.[19] fox Page move-protected Stormtrooper (Star Wars) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigationJump to search \"Imperial Stormtroopers\" redirects here.

Any questions about how this tool works or suggestions can be directed to info@auditscripts.com. In order to use this tool, the assessor must only complete the answers to the drop down menu questions lists on the pages labeled CSC #1 - CSC #20. By choosing a drop down choice for each critical control, the assessment tool will automatically generate scores and maturity level based on the answers to each question. Based on the answers to each question, the dashboard worksheet will automatically populate with the overall maturity level scores for the organization as a whole. These scores can therefore be used to measure the organization's progress and what percentage of the Critical Security Controls they are currently following.

This is caused by Windows holding a lock on the files for longer than normal, which is behavior associated with the Details view and Preview Pane layout. Per Microsoft Support, the cause of this issue is a sharing violation that happens between the operating system and the Office application over a network resource. WORKAROUNDS On desktops accessing the files on a remote shared folder, modify the following settings to disable the Windows functions that cause this behavior: Windows Explorer: 1. Click one of the following: Tools > Folder Options > View or Organize >Folder and search options. o Clear Show pop-up description for folder and desktop items. o Clear Show preview handlers in preview pane. 2. Click Organize -> Layout. o Clear Details Pane. o Clear Preview Pane. In Office 2010: 1. Go to File > Options > Trust center > Trust Center settings. 2. Clear Protected View. 3. Click OK. In Office 2010/2013: 1. Go to File > Options > Trust center > Trust Center settings > Trusted Locations. 2. Place a check next to Allow Trusted Locations on my network as shown below. 3. Click OK.

REFERENCES: a. AFP SOP Nr 04 dated 30 Jan 2019, Subject: AFP Cyber Risk Assessment. b. AFP Cyber Strategy. c. Circular nr 29 dated 06 December 2017, Subject: PN Cybersecurity Policy. d. 20 Critical Security Controls by SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security (SANS) Institute. 2. PURPOSE: The purpose of this policy is to establish a standard for the administration of user accounts that facilitate access PN information systems. An account, at minimum, consists of a user ID and a password; supplying account information will usually grant access to some set of services and resources. This policy establishes standards for issuing accounts, creating password values, and managing accounts. a) SCOPE: This SOP is applicable to units 6's and CEIS units for the management of user accounts or access to shared information or network devices. b) DEFINITION OF TERMS: a. Asset - is any data, device, or other component of the environment that supports information-related activities. Assets generally include hardware (e.g. servers and switches), software (e.g. mission critical applications and support systems) and confidential information. b. Cybersecurity -deliberate synergy of technologies, processes, and practices to protect information and the networks, computer systems and appliances, and programs used to collect, process, store, and transport that information from attack, damage and unauthorized access. c. Cybersecurity Posture – refers to the overall cybersecurity strength of an PN. It expresses the relative security of the IT estate and its vulnerability to outside threats. d. Risk Assessment – is a process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks of PNal assets and operations. It involves evaluating hazards, and developing plans to remove or minimize the level of risk. e. Security Controls - refers to technical, physical, and administrative safeguards to detect cyber threats, minimize risks, and protect from cyber attacks. c) POLICIES: a. Account Administration Accounts that access electronic computing and information resources require prudent oversight. The following security precautions should be part of account management: 1) Issuance of Accounts a) The PN shall issue a unique account to each individual authorized to access that networked computing and information resource. b) When establishing accounts, standard security principles of \"least required access\" to perform a function must always be used, where administratively feasible. For example, a root or administrative privileged account must not be used when a non-privileged account will do. c) Passwords for new accounts should NOT be emailed to remote users UNLESS the email is encrypted. d) The date when the account was issued should be recorded in an audit log or captured electronically. 2) Management of Accounts a) All accounts shall be reviewed at least annually to ensure that access and account privileges are commensurate with job function, need-to- know, and employment status. b) All guest accounts with access to PN network shall contain an expiration date of one year or the work completion date, whichever occurs first. c) Require multi-factor authentication for all user accounts, on all systems, whether managed onsite or by a third-party provider. 3) Account Monitoring a) Maintain an inventory of each of the PN's authentication systems, including those located onsite or at a remote service provider. b) Maintain an inventory of all accounts organized by authentication system. d) Ensure that all accounts have an expiration date that is monitored and enforced. e) Configure access for all accounts through as few centralized points of authentication as possible, including network, security, and cloud systems. c) Establish and follow an automated process for revoking system access by disabling accounts immediately upon termination or change of responsibilities PN personnel. Disabling these accounts, instead of deleting accounts, allows preservation of audit trails. d) Automatically disable dormant accounts after a set period of inactivity. e) Monitor attempts to access deactivated accounts through audit logging. f) Alert when users deviate from normal login behavior, such as time-of-day, workstation location and duration. g) Automatically lock workstation sessions after a standard period of inactivity 4) Administration of Password a) The identity of users must be authenticated before providing them with ID and password details. In addition, it is required that stricter levels of authentication (such as face-to-face) be used for those accounts with privileged access. b) Whenever possible, passkeys should be used to authenticate a user when resetting a password or activating a guest account, and should comply with the abo","routeslip":"","__v":0}

This is similar to VOIP framework Hybrid P2P and Cloud-based architecture Web Real-time Communication (RTC) Protocol -Skype proprietary technology -Formerly a P2P architecture but modified into MSN or server-based architecture Verdict: The PN On-Premise JITSI presents a better solution for a secure Video Teleconference System (VTS) but requires considerable cost to build and maintain its infrastructure (i.e. server, firewall, High-capacity Internet bandwidth, etc). On the other hand, the CISCO webex, with its E2E encryption, is a good alternative for secure and readily-available VTS at a reasonable price. The Zimbra CONNECT is similar to the PN JITSI implementation; and that it is installed on-premise or within the PN Datacenter. However, this requires additional license fee (on top of the client license already procured by the PN) for this feature to be enabled. Another solution worthy to consider is the Microsoft TEAM. The strength of TEAM draws from its native integration with the Office 365 – a popular online office productivity suite for teleworking. The need for collaboration, document sharing, online editing, messaging, teleconference, and unified communication (i.e. sharepoint and email exchange) is now delivered to the user on a single dashboard or portal without opening or logging-in to several applications. (While the Microsoft guarantees application layer encryption, the question sir is ownership of these documents when uploaded to the Microsoft Server since there is no legal contract that prohibits Microsoft from sharing these to their Government) All solutions employ peer-to-peer technology for faster audio and video transmission.","routeslip":"","__v":0}

The Chief of Cyber Warfare Branch, ON6 together with CDR SALVADOR SAMBALILO PN, LCDR JAMES MINGUILLAN PN, and Mr. Nelson G. Maligro attended the product presentation of IELTA on 211300H November 2017 at the Manila Peninsula Hotel, Makati City. 2. The proponent presented the Conceptus System, a social media and web intelligence platform. The following are salient features of the system: a. Passive intelligence collection from social media and the web through creation of a seemingly legit social media personality (Avatar) that will blend in with the group or person of interest (POI); b. Crawls social media, deep web, darknet and bitcoin websites to collect valuable intelligence information about the POI; c. Generates actionable recommendation to grow and improve the avatar's reputation; and d. Correlates information from bitcoin transactions to provide further insights into the identity of the POI. 3. While similar products, like the Knowlesys, have already been introduced to the PN, this branch is unable to determine the value and cost-benefit analysis of the system since this is a tool for Intelligence gathering. As such, we shall forward its brochure and other pertinent information to the TIG, NISF for their evaluation. 4. For information of the AC of NS for C4ISR Systems.

Operational procedure and method of testing and evaluation are explained to measure its effectiveness based on predefined parameters. Project Design The Cryptographic Instant Messaging (CIM) system is Instant Messaging (IM) application software that provides encrypted chat communication and file transfer for secure and reliable exchange of information. Figure 2. Interface Diagram of CIM IM Relay Server INTERNET Encrypt Decrypt Receive Send Client X Client Y 1592304693787 1592305016431 16 Jun 2020 28 Operational Concept and Dataflow Figure 2 from the previous page illustrates the fundamental structure of the system and flow of data from an end-user's perspective. Client X initiates a chat conversation with Client Y using the CIM client software. During the chat conversation, the system automatically encrypts the text message prior sending it to the IM Relay Server. The server now searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server transmits the encrypted text message to Client Y (recipient) through its socket. The server manages all clients' sockets. It handles authentication of all incoming clients prior acceptance of the socket. IM Relay Server maintains a minimal database using MS SQL Server, SQL Express, or MS Access for accounts and activity logs. As soon as the text message arrived at Client Y (recipient), the software then decrypts the text using the system-generated key as the default. Unreadable message or randomized characters indicates unmatched passkey. Both Client X (sender) and Client Y (recipient) must encode manually the correct or agreed passkey to decode their conversation. The manual encoding of a passkey is done to deny the system administrator or any authority from decoding the message during the conduct of any special investigation. System generated keys are stored in the server specifically for this purpose. It is strongly suggested that this manual key should be transmitted through another mode of transmission like SMS, Email, or voice call. A similar procedure can be done during sending and receiving files. Client X starts up the File Transfer window and browse for the file. By default, CIM uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit to encrypt and decrypt text messages and files. The sender can choose to double encrypt the file by hiding it in an image file using 29 steganography or Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm. A checkbox or option button is provided for this feature. By checking both AES and HIPS, the system first encrypts the file using AES and hides the resulting file into an image. The CIM then transmits the image file to the IM relay server. The server searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server relays the file or message to Client Y (recipient). As soon as the encrypted file or image file arrived, the user can now browse for the file and choose to open it with the same application. The encrypted file is extracted from the image file using the HIPS function for file extraction. After the successful extraction, the CIM now tries to decrypt the extracted file using the system-generated key. If unsuccessful, it asks for the passkey which must be encoded by the receiving user to convert the encrypted file back to its original form. Manual encoding of passkey happens when the sender chooses to encode a different key other than the default system-generated key. Network Architecture To visualize its deployment from a technical perspective, the network diagram is drawn for this purpose. In figure 3 of the next page, the CIM primarily utilizes the Local Area Network (LAN) for inter-office instant messaging and collaboration. Client X (desktop computer) transmits messages to Client Y (laptop computer) through the adjacent relay server within the same LAN. 30 Figure 3. Local Area Network (LAN) Setup of CIM The CIM is also applicable to clients outside the office and anywhere in the world. For a Wide Area Network (WAN) setup, the Internet is utilized. The IM Relay Server is assigned with a global or public IP address to allow connection from clients outside of its network. This allows interconnectivity among regional offices, company branches, or widely dispersed units through this system. Figure 4. Wide Area Network (WAN) Setup of CIM 31 Users who bring their work at home can now securely communicate and send files to the main office through the CIM. Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) provide optional security reinforcement at the network layer between the CIM relay server and CIM client. Servers are ideally housed in a Data Center for a large-scale deployment.

On the other hand, the CISCO webex, with its E2E encryption, is a good alternative for secure and readily-available VTS at a reasonable price. The Zimbra CONNECT is similar to the PN JITSI implementation; and that it is installed on-premise or within the PN Datacenter. However, this requires additional license fee (on top of the client license already procured by the PN) for this feature to be enabled. Another solution worthy to consider is the Microsoft TEAM. The strength of TEAM draws from its native integration with the Office 365 – a popular online office productivity suite for teleworking. The need for collaboration, document sharing, online editing, messaging, teleconference, and unified communication (i.e. sharepoint and email exchange) is now delivered to the user on a single dashboard or portal without opening or logging-in to several applications. (While the Microsoft guarantees application layer encryption, the question sir is ownership of these documents when uploaded to the Microsoft Server since there is no legal contract that prohibits Microsoft from sharing these to their Government) All solutions employ peer-to-peer technology for faster audio and video transmission.","routeslip":"","__v":0}

Operational procedure and method of testing and evaluation are explained to measure its effectiveness based on predefined parameters. Project Design The Cryptographic Instant Messaging (CIM) system is Instant Messaging (IM) application software that provides encrypted chat communication and file transfer for secure and reliable exchange of information. Figure 2. Interface Diagram of CIM IM Relay Server INTERNET Encrypt Decrypt Receive Send Client X Client Y 1592304693787 1592305016431 16 Jun 2020 1592308458492 16 Jun 2020 28 Operational Concept and Dataflow Figure 2 from the previous page illustrates the fundamental structure of the system and flow of data from an end-user's perspective. Client X initiates a chat conversation with Client Y using the CIM client software. During the chat conversation, the system automatically encrypts the text message prior sending it to the IM Relay Server. The server now searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server transmits the encrypted text message to Client Y (recipient) through its socket. The server manages all clients' sockets. It handles authentication of all incoming clients prior acceptance of the socket. IM Relay Server maintains a minimal database using MS SQL Server, SQL Express, or MS Access for accounts and activity logs. As soon as the text message arrived at Client Y (recipient), the software then decrypts the text using the system-generated key as the default. Unreadable message or randomized characters indicates unmatched passkey. Both Client X (sender) and Client Y (recipient) must encode manually the correct or agreed passkey to decode their conversation. The manual encoding of a passkey is done to deny the system administrator or any authority from decoding the message during the conduct of any special investigation. System generated keys are stored in the server specifically for this purpose. It is strongly suggested that this manual key should be transmitted through another mode of transmission like SMS, Email, or voice call. A similar procedure can be done during sending and receiving files. Client X starts up the File Transfer window and browse for the file. By default, CIM uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit to encrypt and decrypt text messages and files. The sender can choose to double encrypt the file by hiding it in an image file using 29 steganography or Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm. A checkbox or option button is provided for this feature. By checking both AES and HIPS, the system first encrypts the file using AES and hides the resulting file into an image. The CIM then transmits the image file to the IM relay server. The server searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server relays the file or message to Client Y (recipient). As soon as the encrypted file or image file arrived, the user can now browse for the file and choose to open it with the same application. The encrypted file is extracted from the image file using the HIPS function for file extraction. After the successful extraction, the CIM now tries to decrypt the extracted file using the system-generated key. If unsuccessful, it asks for the passkey which must be encoded by the receiving user to convert the encrypted file back to its original form. Manual encoding of passkey happens when the sender chooses to encode a different key other than the default system-generated key. Network Architecture To visualize its deployment from a technical perspective, the network diagram is drawn for this purpose. In figure 3 of the next page, the CIM primarily utilizes the Local Area Network (LAN) for inter-office instant messaging and collaboration. Client X (desktop computer) transmits messages to Client Y (laptop computer) through the adjacent relay server within the same LAN. 30 Figure 3. Local Area Network (LAN) Setup of CIM The CIM is also applicable to clients outside the office and anywhere in the world. For a Wide Area Network (WAN) setup, the Internet is utilized. The IM Relay Server is assigned with a global or public IP address to allow connection from clients outside of its network. This allows interconnectivity among regional offices, company branches, or widely dispersed units through this system. Figure 4. Wide Area Network (WAN) Setup of CIM 31 Users who bring their work at home can now securely communicate and send files to the main office through the CIM. Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) provide optional security reinforcement at the network layer between the CIM relay server and CIM client. Servers are ideally housed in a Data Center for a large-scale deployment. System Analysis and Design The interaction between the system and users is explai","routeslip":"","__v":0}

It involves the use of email, instant messaging, video conference, chat, online forums, and other applications that transmit data from sender to receiver. Many organizations and modern companies prefer to use instant messaging rather than email for simpler and more user- friendly collaboration among staff and management. It also exchanges data almost at an instant, allowing two-way communication in near real-time. Instant messaging applications like Facebook messenger, SKYPE, and Yahoo Messenger provide easy, fast, and cost-effective means of text, voice, and video communication. It has become the most preferred application to communicate with peers, families, and among professionals from various industries and sectors. Businesses are now beginning to embrace IM for their office communication. Although it is less formal than a face to face meeting, it can bridge the gap of needing to collaborate and communicate with each other. Private companies, schools, organizations, and government agencies use IM to support or provide redundancy with their other existing mode of communication. The military recognizes the necessity to develop or acquire a secure, reliable, and near real-time data communication tool for effective exchange of information and to provide the high-command a means to collate information needed for decision-making. In 1592299383754 1592304397694 2 today's network-centric operation, Instant Messaging (IM) is an essential information communication tool for rapid delivery of messages and reports, and for situational awareness. The US military has long been using IM for its military operations. In fact, Cummings (2004, p. 654) stated that \"it was the primary means of communication between navy ships during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003\". The Philippine Navy (PN), a branch of service in the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), sought to acquire similar tool but is constrained with limited resources and lack of communication infrastructure to securely extend its network to mobile units thereby utilizing the un- secure Internet for its data communication. The PN, with its prevailing need for a secure data communication like an instant messaging, started to adopt several free and open-source IM but unsatisfied with the minimal encryption it provides. Text messages can be intercepted, decoded, and read in clear text as it travels across the network from sender to receiver. The pervasiveness of these applications makes it vulnerable from various attacks especially sniffing and hijacking. Some vendors, however, promise end-to-end or asynchronous encryption with their expensive commercial IM. They may either use open-standard advanced encryption protocols or they are using closed and proprietary protocols. The benefit it provides may surpass that of the free versions, however, the vendor obscures any vulnerabilities of this application from the end-users and it will not be long until a sophisticated hacker can crack its encryption protocol through a purchase of similar application. Among the popular IMs available online are unencrypted by default such as Facebook Messenger, Pidgin, Google Allo, and Viber. IMs are designed with usability 3 rather than security in mind. Almost all freeware IM software does not have encryption capabilities. Few news articles can be found as an evidence of this vulnerability, many IM vendors bargain this flaw as leverage for the users to purchase the licensed version. Eavesdropping and sniffing IM conversation is common to most hackers and cybersecurity professionals especially if they are within the Local Area Network (LAN). Data security is of utmost importance in any organization whether private or government sector. The effect of confidential messages being sniffed, leaked, or compromised can be devastating to any individuals, businesses or institutions such as the Armed Forces. Quality of software should be measured not just by the functionality and performance but also the security it guarantees. It has to assure the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and availability of the data it processes. Thus, adoption of an encryption mechanism is imperative to secure the data at-rest or in-transit. The growing importance of security for an IM or for any type of application cannot be overemphasized. All communication application (i.e Instant Messenger) must be integrated with an encryption algorithm that is proven unbreakable and resistant to any mathematical cracking techniques.

On the other hand, the CISCO webex, with its E2E encryption, is a good alternative for secure and readily-available VTS at a reasonable price. The Zimbra CONNECT is similar to the PN JITSI implementation; and that it is installed on-premise or within the PN Datacenter. However, this requires additional license fee (on top of the client license already procured by the PN) for this feature to be enabled. Another solution worthy to consider is the Microsoft TEAM. The strength of TEAM draws from its native integration with the Office 365 – a popular online office productivity suite for teleworking. The need for collaboration, document sharing, online editing, messaging, teleconference, and unified communication (i.e. sharepoint and email exchange) is now delivered to the user on a single dashboard or portal without opening or logging-in to several applications. (While the Microsoft guarantees application layer encryption, the question sir is ownership of these documents when uploaded to the Microsoft Server since there is no legal contract that prohibits Microsoft from sharing these to their Government) All solutions employ peer-to-peer technology for faster audio and video transmission.","routeslip":"","__v":0}

FaceApp, released in 2017, is a mobile application that allows users to generate realistic transformations of their faces which became one of the most downloaded mobile applications across the world today. The FaceApp application has started to circulate on social networks after the free launch of the \"gender swap\" filter. The new craze has generated the hashtag \"faceappchallenge\" and received hundreds of thousands of shares on Facebook and Instagram. 1595487585012 23 Jul 2020 The Gender-Swapping Challenge The app's gender-swapping features became the new highlight as users shared what they look like should they alter their sexual orientations. Local officials who participated in the trend include Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, Kabataan Rep. Sarah Elago, and Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles. Being isolated and stuck at home during the pandemic has prompted people to spend more time on social media than ever before. Keeping themselves updated with news and connecting with friends and families are among the top reasons. But people have also been turning to social media to deal with stress and anxiety. The realistic, interesting, and sometimes funny results of the tweaked images that FaceApp generates made it stand out in the market. However, some Filipinos warned against the consequences of exposing their data to a mobile program. One Facebook user noted that it was only weeks ago when the sudden emergence of clone or dummy accounts on the social media giant caused public alarm. Photos are also Personal Data This application took advantage of the internet population's fondness for sharing photos. However, experts raised some issues with the app, particularly at its privacy policies. The main risks found are: 1. Possibility of making your Personal data such as location and username public 2. Granting the company behind FaceApp consent to use your Personal data without compensation. 3. Possibility of giving your Personal data to intelligence thieves or hackers. Essentially, all free apps hoover up a distressingly large amount of users' Personal data. Some definitely have better privacy polices than others. Jake Moore, cybersecurity specialist at ESET warns: \"When anything is free, you must always ask yourself what is in it for the owners of the app and how do they make their money?\" Good Data Security and Privacy Practice As such, PN personnel are cautioned from using the application and encouraged to be aware of its security features first before joining any social media challenge. It is also important to read the privacy terms of the applications and understand what rights and types of access are being requested. Additionally, when you or your family members are downloading applications, you must take the following precautions: 1. Make sure the app is reliable and is downloaded from official websites PUNONGHIMPILAN HUKBONG DAGAT NG PILIPINAS (Headquarters Philippine Navy) Office of the AC of NS for C4ISR Systems, N6 Naval Station Jose Andrada 2335 Roxas Boulevard, Manila N6B CYBERSECURITY BULLETIN: 2020–13 Filipinos Warned Against the Consequences of Exposing Their Data To a Mobile Application Sourced from: https://manilastandard.net/tech/tech-news/326498/new-faceapp-no-malicious- elements-but-users-must-be-careful.html Security concerns about Russian-based FaceApp resurfaced anew nearly a month after the emergence of clone or ghost accounts on Facebook.

GENERAL: In order to reduce the ability of attackers to find and exploit unauthorized and unprotected systems, there is a need to use active monitoring, manage configuration and maintain an up-to-date inventory of devices connected to the enterprise network, including servers, workstations, laptops, and remote devices. Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all software on the network so that only authorized software is installed and can execute, and that unauthorized and unmanaged software is found and prevented from installation or execution. Maintaining inventories for hardware and software will identify vulnerable systems, detect malicious software, mitigate unpatched software, and root out attacks. 3. PURPOSE: This SOP prescribes the general guidelines to units 6's and CEIS units for the inventory of Information Technology (IT) hardware and software 4. SCOPE: This covers all PN Staff Officer for CEIS/C4ISR and PN CEIS units. 5. DEFINITION OF TERMS: a. Asset - is any data, device, or other component of the environment that supports information-related activities. Assets generally include hardware (e.g. servers and switches), software (e.g. mission critical applications and support systems) and confidential information. b. Cyber – is a prefix for a term or the modifier of a compound word, rather than a stand-alone word which usually relates to electronic data processing, information technology, electronic communications or information and computer systems. c. Cyber defense – Comprises actions to protect the PN cyberspace and ensure continues utilization of critical information and communication infrastructure. The Defensive Cyberspace Operation (DCO) involves the use of passive and active measures and includes the use of network security appliances, threat management hardware and software, information assurance policies, and all other essential tasks to secure the network connectivity, sustain network operations, and use of information systems residing in PN cyberspace. d. Cybersecurity -deliberate synergy of technologies, processes, and practices to protect information and the networks, computer systems and appliances, and programs used to collect, process, store, and transport that information from attack, damage and unauthorized access. e. Cybersecurity Posture – refers to the overall cybersecurity strength of an organization. It expresses the relative security of the IT estate and its vulnerability to outside threats. f. Cyber Risk Assessment – is a process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks of organizational information assets, individuals, and operations involving Information and Communication Technology (ICT). It involves evaluating hazards, and developing plans to remove or minimize the level of risk. g. Data Loss - is an error condition in information systems in which information is destroyed by failures or neglect in storage, transmission, or processing. h. Incident Response - refers to activities of detection, protection, and response to computer security incidents, critical data, assets, and systems. i. Penetration testing - colloquially known as a pen test, is an authorized simulated attack on a computer system that looks for security weaknesses, potentially gaining access to the system's feature and data. j. Risk Assessment – is a process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks of organizational assets and operations. It involves evaluating hazards, and developing plans to remove or minimize the level of risk. k. Security Controls - refers to technical, physical, and administrative safeguards to detect cyber threats, minimize risks, and protect from cyber attacks. l.

Fund Support: Training fees and hotel accommodation were provided by this office. IV. Observations/Lessons Learned: The RootCon event was an eye-opening experience to ON6 and NICTC personnel. The presenters unselfishly shared their experience on the latest techniques on breaking a system, carving advanced malware such as the APT, and effective ways of hunting threats. The following are the topics that were discussed: 1. Navigating the Shift from Opportunistic to Targeted Ransomware - Attackers have been hitting organizations hard by flooding ransomware onto computers and network shares; and demanding drastically high ransoms in return for decrypted data. 2. SQL Injection from Mutation to Polymorphism - A brief introduction of the mutation technique, the differences among other evasion techniques, the scheme, the algorithm, and the potential risks it may raise in the future. 3. Semi-Automated Patch Diffing by Applying Machine-Learning Techniques - Patch diffing (binary diffing) is one of the major techniques to identify that security fixes are applied. Various tools include BinDiff, TurboDiff, and Diaphora have been developed. 4. Hunting Threats with Wireshark Plugins - Converting our traffic analysis tool Wireshark, to an extensible, free platform independent threat/signature/attack hunter tool 5. Man-In-The-Middle attack against a certain password manager - Man-in-the-middle attack against a certain password management application. The password was exchanged in plain text between .exe and .dll, and it was very easy to steal it. Aside from lectures, various activities were also conducted during the two (2) days event. Below are note-worthy observations: 1. Villages or booth were setup to provide hands-on experience on fixing and soldering Arduino boards, lock picking, and car-jacking. This is to provide awareness to the participants on how real the threats are. 2. There is a separate room for learning basics of hacking. 3. Advance methodologies were presented straight from recognized ethical hackers and security researchers. These lecturers had previously spoken at DEFCON, SECCON, and BlackHat– a US hackers' conference. 4. Separate track for the Captu","routeslip":"","__v":0}

Weller, featuring a cowboy in front of the Cane Hill mental asylum.[16] Weller, whose friend was a patient there, suggested the idea after Bowie had asked him to create a design that would capture the music's foreboding tone. Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design's foreground, he used a photograph of John Wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten-gallon hat and a rifle, which was meant as an allusion to the song \"Running Gun Blues\". Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the \"exploding head\" signature on the cowboy's hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to have the line \"roll up your sleeves and show us your arms\"—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risqué and the balloon was left blank. According to Bowie biographer Nicholas Pegg, \"at this point, David's intention was to call the album Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's Metropolis: the title would remain on the tape boxes even after Mercury had released the LP in America as The Man Who Sold the World.\"[4] Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a \"domestic environment\" of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin \"man's dress\", an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance.[4] The dress was designed by British fashion designer Michael Fish.[17] It has been said that his \"bleached blond locks, falling below shoulder level\" in the photo, were inspired by a Pre-Raphaelite painting by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.[18] In the United States, Mercury rejected MacMillan's photo and released the album with Weller's design as its cover, much to the displeasure of Bowie, although he successfully lobbied the label to use the photo for the record's release in the United Kingdom. In 1972, he said Weller's design was \"horrible\" but reappraised it in 1999, saying he \"actually thought the cartoon cover was really cool\".[4] While promoting The Man Who Sold the World in the US, Bowie wore the Mr Fish dress in February 1971 on his first promotional tour and during interviews, despite the fact that the Americans had no knowledge of the as yet unreleased UK cover.[17] The 1971 German release presented a winged hybrid creature with Bowie's head and a hand for a body, preparing to flick the Earth away. The 1972 worldwide reissue by RCA Records used a black-and-white picture of Ziggy Stardust on the sleeve. This image remained the cover art on reissues until 1990, when the Rykodisc release reinstated the UK \"dress\" cover. The \"dress\" cover has appeared on subsequent reissues of the album.[19] fox Page move-protected Stormtrooper (Star Wars) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigationJump to search \"Imperial Stormtroopers\" redirects here.

Fund Support: Training fees and hotel accommodation were provided by this office. IV. Observations/Lessons Learned: The RootCon event was an eye-opening experience to ON6 and NICTC personnel. The presenters unselfishly shared their experience on the latest techniques on breaking a system, carving advanced malware such as the APT, and effective ways of hunting threats. The following are the topics that were discussed: 1. Navigating the Shift from Opportunistic to Targeted Ransomware - Attackers have been hitting organizations hard by flooding ransomware onto computers and network shares; and demanding drastically high ransoms in return for decrypted data. 2. SQL Injection from Mutation to Polymorphism - A brief introduction of the mutation technique, the differences among other evasion techniques, the scheme, the algorithm, and the potential risks it may raise in the future. 3. Semi-Automated Patch Diffing by Applying Machine-Learning Techniques - Patch diffing (binary diffing) is one of the major techniques to identify that security fixes are applied. Various tools include BinDiff, TurboDiff, and Diaphora have been developed. 4. Hunting Threats with Wireshark Plugins - Converting our traffic analysis tool Wireshark, to an extensible, free platform independent threat/signature/attack hunter tool 5. Man-In-The-Middle attack against a certain password manager - Man-in-the-middle attack against a certain password management application. The password was exchanged in plain text between .exe and .dll, and it was very easy to steal it. Aside from lectures, various activities were also conducted during the two (2) days event. Below are note-worthy observations: 1. Villages or booth were setup to provide hands-on experience on fixing and soldering Arduino boards, lock picking, and car-jacking. This is to provide awareness to the participants on how real the threats are. 2. There is a separate room for learning basics of hacking. 3. Advance methodologies were presented straight from recognized ethical hackers and security researchers. These lecturers had previously spoken at DEFCON, SECCON, and BlackHat– a US hackers' conference.","routeslip":"","__v":0}

Operational procedure and method of testing and evaluation are explained to measure its effectiveness based on predefined parameters. Project Design The Cryptographic Instant Messaging (CIM) system is Instant Messaging (IM) application software that provides encrypted chat communication and file transfer for secure and reliable exchange of information. Figure 2. Interface Diagram of CIM IM Relay Server INTERNET Encrypt Decrypt Receive Send Client X Client Y 1592304693787 28 Operational Concept and Dataflow Figure 2 from the previous page illustrates the fundamental structure of the system and flow of data from an end-user's perspective. Client X initiates a chat conversation with Client Y using the CIM client software. During the chat conversation, the system automatically encrypts the text message prior sending it to the IM Relay Server. The server now searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server transmits the encrypted text message to Client Y (recipient) through its socket. The server manages all clients' sockets. It handles authentication of all incoming clients prior acceptance of the socket. IM Relay Server maintains a minimal database using MS SQL Server, SQL Express, or MS Access for accounts and activity logs. As soon as the text message arrived at Client Y (recipient), the software then decrypts the text using the system-generated key as the default. Unreadable message or randomized characters indicates unmatched passkey. Both Client X (sender) and Client Y (recipient) must encode manually the correct or agreed passkey to decode their conversation. The manual encoding of a passkey is done to deny the system administrator or any authority from decoding the message during the conduct of any special investigation. System generated keys are stored in the server specifically for this purpose. It is strongly suggested that this manual key should be transmitted through another mode of transmission like SMS, Email, or voice call. A similar procedure can be done during sending and receiving files. Client X starts up the File Transfer window and browse for the file. By default, CIM uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit to encrypt and decrypt text messages and files. The sender can choose to double encrypt the file by hiding it in an image file using 29 steganography or Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm. A checkbox or option button is provided for this feature. By checking both AES and HIPS, the system first encrypts the file using AES and hides the resulting file into an image. The CIM then transmits the image file to the IM relay server. The server searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server relays the file or message to Client Y (recipient). As soon as the encrypted file or image file arrived, the user can now browse for the file and choose to open it with the same application. The encrypted file is extracted from the image file using the HIPS function for file extraction. After the successful extraction, the CIM now tries to decrypt the extracted file using the system-generated key. If unsuccessful, it asks for the passkey which must be encoded by the receiving user to convert the encrypted file back to its original form. Manual encoding of passkey happens when the sender chooses to encode a different key other than the default system-generated key. Network Architecture To visualize its deployment from a technical perspective, the network diagram is drawn for this purpose. In figure 3 of the next page, the CIM primarily utilizes the Local Area Network (LAN) for inter-office instant messaging and collaboration. Client X (desktop computer) transmits messages to Client Y (laptop computer) through the adjacent relay server within the same LAN. 30 Figure 3. Local Area Network (LAN) Setup of CIM The CIM is also applicable to clients outside the office and anywhere in the world. For a Wide Area Network (WAN) setup, the Internet is utilized. The IM Relay Server is assigned with a global or public IP address to allow connection from clients outside of its network. This allows interconnectivity among regional offices, company branches, or widely dispersed units through this system. Figure 4. Wide Area Network (WAN) Setup of CIM 31 Users who bring their work at home can now securely communicate and send files to the main office through the CIM. Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) provide optional security reinforcement at the network layer between the CIM relay server and CIM client. Servers are ideally housed in a Data Center for a large-scale deployment.

Invite PS3 and PS6 of AFP PS to be involved in the Procurement System next week. 2. Sub-phases for the PHASE 1 (275 working days) are: a. Sub Phase 1 – Competitive Bidding (95 working days) b. Sub Phase 2 – Alternative mode of procurement c. Sub Phase 3 – File Uploading 3. Submit documentary requirements to COA prior NTP. 4. Phase 2 – implement PKI and Bar coding 5. Phase 3 Cloud based, data analytics, and notification service 6. For modification: a. Delete option is deleted b. Monitoring number of dates, warning to user for the number of dates. c. Progress or milestone payment (this maybe irrelevant because of the \"remark\" option) d. Growth repair 7. Procurement service only encodes contract number and not controls number. 8. Project Control number will be the UPR number. End user will encode the UPS number. 9. Add contract number for PS. drop down \"mode of procurement – Competitive bidding and alternative mode\", Display \"NOA and supplier\" if alternative mode of procurement. 10. Separate interface for internal end users (FOIC monitoring) and public users (supplier). 11. Remove \"remarks\" in public viewing status only. 12. Develop Flowchart for the end users appreciation. Next week. 13. Workshop next week for PRISM. 14. Conference Meeting on 03 September 2019 at 1500H. Agenda: Updates on NRC MIS 1.

Users training 12 September. 1594126460911 28 Operational Concept and Dataflow Figure 2 from the previous page illustrates the fundamental structure of the system and flow of data from an end-user's perspective. Client X initiates a chat conversation with Client Y using the CIM client software. During the chat conversation, the system automatically encrypts the text message prior sending it to the IM Relay Server. The server now searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server transmits the encrypted text message to Client Y (recipient) through its socket. The server manages all clients' sockets. It handles authentication of all incoming clients prior acceptance of the socket. IM Relay Server maintains a minimal database using MS SQL Server, SQL Express, or MS Access for accounts and activity logs. As soon as the text message arrived at Client Y (recipient), the software then decrypts the text using the system-generated key as the default. Unreadable message or randomized characters indicates unmatched passkey. Both Client X (sender) and Client Y (recipient) must encode manually the correct or agreed passkey to decode their conversation. The manual encoding of a passkey is done to deny the system administrator or any authority from decoding the message during the conduct of any special investigation. System generated keys are stored in the server specifically for this purpose. It is strongly suggested that this manual key should be transmitted through another mode of transmission like SMS, Email, or voice call. A similar procedure can be done during sending and receiving files. Client X starts up the File Transfer window and browse for the file. By default, CIM uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit to encrypt and decrypt text messages and files. The sender can choose to double encrypt the file by hiding it in an image file using 29 steganography or Hidden in Plain Sight (HIPS) algorithm. A checkbox or option button is provided for this feature. By checking both AES and HIPS, the system first encrypts the file using AES and hides the resulting file into an image. The CIM then transmits the image file to the IM relay server. The server searches for the intended recipient from its list of client sockets. When the recipient's socket is available, the server relays the file or message to Client Y (recipient). As soon as the encrypted file or image file arrived, the user can now browse for the file and choose to open it with the same application. The encrypted file is extracted from the image file using the HIPS function for file extraction. After the successful extraction, the CIM now tries to decrypt the extracted file using the system-generated key. If unsuccessful, it asks for the passkey which must be encoded by the receiving user to convert the encrypted file back to its original form. Manual encoding of passkey happens when the sender chooses to encode a different key other than the default system-generated key.

Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices, Laptop, Workstations, and Servers Prevent attackers from exploiting services and settings that allow easy access through networks and browsers: Build a secure image that is used for all new systems deployed to the enterprises, host these standard images on secure storage servers, regularly validate and update these configurations, and track system images in a configuration management system. 4. Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation Proactively identify and repair software vulnerabilities reported by security researchers or vendors: Regularly run automated vulnerability scanning tools against all systems and quickly remediate any vulnerabilities, which critical problems fixed within 48 hours. 5. Malware Defenses Block malicious code from tampering with system settings or contents, capturing sensitive data, or spreading: Use automated anti-virus and anti- 1588087378022 spyware to continuously monitor and protect workstations, servers, and mobile devices. Automatically update such anti-malware tools on all machines on a daily basis. Prevent network devices from using auto-run programs to access removable media. 6. Application Software Security Neutralize vulnerabilities in web-based and other applications software: Carefully test internally developed and third-party application software for security flaws, including coding errors and malware. Deploy web application firewalls that inspect all traffic, and explicitly check for errors in all users input (including by size and data type). 7. Wireless Device Control Protect the security perimeter against unauthorized wireless access. Allow wireless devices to connect to the network only if they match an authorized configuration and security profile and have a documented owner and defined business need. Ensure that all wireless access points are manageable using enterprise management tools. Configure scanning tools to detect wireless access points. 8. Data Recovery Capability Minimize the damage from an attack: Implement a trustworthy plan for removing all traces an attack. Automatically back up all information required to fully restore each system, including the operating system, application software, and data. Back up all systems at least weekly; back up sensitive systems more often. Regularly test the restoration process. 9. Security Skills Assessment and Appropriate Training to Fill Gaps Find knowledge gaps, and fill them with exercises and training: Develop security skills assessment program, map training against the skills required for each job, and use the results to allocate resources effectively to improve security practices. 10. Secure Configurations for Network Devices such as Firewalls, Router, and Switches Preclude electronic holes from forming at connection points with the Internet, other organizations, and internal networks segments: Compare firewall, router, and switch configurations against standards for each type of networks device. Ensure that any deviations from the standard configurations are documented and approved and that any temporary deviations are undone when the business need abates. 11. Limited and Control of Networks Ports, Protocols, and Services Allow remote access only to legitimate users and services: Apply host- based firewalls and port-filtering and scanning tools to block traffic that is not explicitly allowed. Properly configure web servers, mail servers, file and print services, and domain name system (DNS) servers to limit remote access. Disable automatic installation of unnecessary software components. Move servers inside the firewall unless remote access is required for business purposes. 12. Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges Protect and validate administrative accounts on desktops, laptops, and servers to prevent two common types of attack (1) enticing users to open a malicious e-mail, attachment, or file, or to visit a malicious website; and (2) cracking an administrative password and thereby gaining access to","routeslip":"","__v":0}
